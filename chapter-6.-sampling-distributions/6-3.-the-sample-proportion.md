# 6-3. The Sample Proportion

Often sampling is done in order to estimate the proportion of a population that has a specific characteristic, such as the proportion of all items coming off an assembly line that are defective or the proportion of all people entering a retail store who make a purchase before leaving. The population proportion is denoted _p_ and the sample proportion is denoted pˆ.p^. Thus if in reality 43% of people entering a store make a purchase before leaving, _p_ = 0.43; if in a sample of 200 people entering the store, 78 make a purchase, pˆ=78/200=0.39.p^=78/200=0.39.

The sample proportion is a random variable: it varies from sample to sample in a way that cannot be predicted with certainty. Viewed as a random variable it will be written Pˆ.P^. It has a mean μPˆμP^ and a standard deviation σPˆ.σP^. Here are formulas for their values.

Suppose random samples of size _n_ are drawn from a population in which the proportion with a characteristic of interest is _p_. The mean μPˆμP^ and standard deviation σPˆσP^ of the sample proportion PˆP^ satisfyμPˆ=p  and  σPˆ=pqn−−−√μP^=p  and  σP^=pqn

where q=1−p.q=1−p.

The Central Limit Theorem has an analogue for the population proportion Pˆ.P^. To see how, imagine that every element of the population that has the characteristic of interest is labeled with a 1, and that every element that does not is labeled with a 0. This gives a numerical population consisting entirely of zeros and ones. Clearly the proportion of the population with the special characteristic is the proportion of the numerical population that are ones; in symbols,p=number of 1sNp=number of 1sN

But of course the sum of all the zeros and ones is simply the number of ones, so the mean _μ_ of the numerical population isμ=ΣxN=number of 1sNμ=ΣxN=number of 1sN

Thus the population proportion _p_ is the same as the mean _μ_ of the corresponding population of zeros and ones. In the same way the sample proportion pˆp^ is the same as the sample mean x−−.x-. Thus the Central Limit Theorem applies to Pˆ.P^. However, the condition that the sample be large is a little more complicated than just being of size at least 30.

#### The Sampling Distribution of the Sample Proportion

For large samples, the sample proportion is approximately normally distributed, with mean μPˆ=pμP^=p and standard deviation σPˆ=pq/n−−−−√.σP^=pq/n.

A sample is large if the interval \[p−3 σPˆ, p+3 σPˆ\]\[p−3 σP^, p+3 σP^\] lies wholly within the interval \[0,1\].\[0,1\].

In actual practice _p_ is not known, hence neither is σPˆ.σP^. In that case in order to check that the sample is sufficiently large we substitute the known quantity pˆp^ for _p_. This means checking that the interval\[pˆ−3 pˆ\(1−pˆ\)n−−−−−−−−√, pˆ+3 pˆ\(1−pˆ\)n−−−−−−−−√ \]\[p^−3 p^\(1−p^\)n, p^+3 p^\(1−p^\)n \]

lies wholly within the interval \[0,1\].\[0,1\]. This is illustrated in the examples.

[Figure 6.5 "Distribution of Sample Proportions"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s10-sampling-distributions.html#fwk-shafer-ch06_s03_f05) shows that when _p_ = 0.1 a sample of size 15 is too small but a sample of size 100 is acceptable. [Figure 6.6 "Distribution of Sample Proportions for "](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s10-sampling-distributions.html#fwk-shafer-ch06_s03_f06) shows that when _p_ = 0.5 a sample of size 15 is acceptable.

#### EXAMPLE 7

Suppose that in a population of voters in a certain region 38% are in favor of particular bond issue. Nine hundred randomly selected voters are asked if they favor the bond issue.

1. Verify that the sample proportion PˆP^ computed from samples of size 900 meets the condition that its sampling distribution be approximately normal.
2. Find the probability that the sample proportion computed from a sample of size 900 will be within 5 percentage points of the true population proportion.
