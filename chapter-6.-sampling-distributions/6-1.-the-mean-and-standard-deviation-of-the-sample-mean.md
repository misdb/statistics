 Suppose we wish to estimate the mean $$μ$$ of a population. In actual practice we would typically take just one sample. Imagine however that we take sample after sample, all of the same size $$n,$$ and compute the sample mean $$x$$ of each one. We will likely get a different value of x−−x- each time. The sample mean x−−x- is a random variable: it varies from sample to sample in a way that cannot be predicted with certainty. We will write X−−X- when the sample mean is thought of as a random variable, and write x−−x- for the values that it takes. The random variable X−−X- has a mean, denoted μX−−μX-, and a standard deviation, denoted σX−−.σX-. Here is an example with such a small population and small sample size that we can actually write down every single sample.
