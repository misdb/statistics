# 6-2. The Sampling Distribution of the Sample Mean





### The Central Limit Theorem

We constructed the probability distribution of the sample mean for samples of size two drawn from the population of four rowers in Section 6.1 "The Mean and Standard Deviation of the Sample Mean" . 

The probability distribution is:

                           $$\bar{x}$$            152   154   156   158   160   162   164  
                         $$P(\bar{x})$$       $$\frac{1}{16}$$    $$\frac{2}{16}$$    $$\frac{3}{16}$$    $$\frac{4}{16}$$    $$\frac{3}{16}$$    $$\frac{2}{16}$$    $$\frac{1}{16}$$ 



The Figure shows a side-by-side comparison of a histogram for the original population and a histogram for this distribution.  Whereas the distribution of the population is uniform, the sampling distribution of the mean has a shape approaching the shape of the familiar bell curve. 

This phenomenon of the sampling distribution of the mean taking on a bell shape even though the population distribution is not bell-shaped happens in general. Here is a somewhat more realistic example.

Suppose we take samples of size 1, 5, 10, or 20 from a population that consists entirely of the numbers 0 and 1, half the population 0, half 1, so that the population mean is 0.5. The sampling distributions are:

Histograms illustrating these distributions are shown in [Figure 6.2 "Distributions of the Sample Mean"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s10-sampling-distributions.html#fwk-shafer-ch06_s02_s01_f02).

As _n_ increases the sampling distribution of X−−X- evolves in an interesting way: the probabilities on the lower and the upper ends shrink and the probabilities in the middle become larger in relation to them. If we were to continue to increase _n_ then the shape of the sampling distribution would become smoother and more bell-shaped.

What we are seeing in these examples does not depend on the particular population distributions involved. In general, one may start with any distribution and the sampling distribution of the sample mean will increasingly resemble the bell-shaped normal curve as the sample size increases. This is the content of the Central Limit Theorem.

#### The Central Limit Theorem

For samples of size 30 or more, the sample mean is approximately normally distributed, with mean μX−−=μμX-=μ and standard deviation σX−−=σ/n−−√σX-=σ/n, where _n_ is the sample size. The larger the sample size, the better the approximation.

The Central Limit Theorem is illustrated for several common population distributions in [Figure 6.3 "Distribution of Populations and Sample Means"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s10-sampling-distributions.html#fwk-shafer-ch06_s02_s01_f03).

The dashed vertical lines in the figures locate the population mean. Regardless of the distribution of the population, as the sample size is increased the shape of the sampling distribution of the sample mean becomes increasingly bell-shaped, centered on the population mean. Typically by the time the sample size is 30 the distribution of the sample mean is practically the same as a normal distribution.

The importance of the Central Limit Theorem is that it allows us to make probability statements about the sample mean, specifically in relation to its value in comparison to the population mean, as we will see in the examples. But to use the result properly we must first realize that there are two separate random variables \(and therefore two probability distributions\) at play:

1. _X_, the measurement of a single element selected at random from the population; the distribution of _X_ is the distribution of the population, with mean the population mean _μ_ and standard deviation the population standard deviation _σ_;
2. X−−X-, the mean of the measurements in a sample of size _n_; the distribution of X−−X- is its sampling distribution, with mean μX−−=μμX-=μ and standard deviation σX−−=σ/n−
