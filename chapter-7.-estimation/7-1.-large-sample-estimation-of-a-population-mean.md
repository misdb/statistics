# 7-1. Large Sample Estimation of a Population Mean

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/ch7\_estimation.pdf" caption="Estimation" %}

If we wish to estimate the mean _μ_ of a population for which a census is impractical, say the average height of all 18-year-old men in the country, a reasonable strategy is to take a sample, compute its mean x−−x-, and estimate the unknown number _μ_ by the known number x−−.x-. For example, if the average height of 100 randomly selected men aged 18 is 70.6 inches, then we would say that the average height of all 18-year-old men is \(at least approximately\) 70.6 inches.

Estimating a population parameter by a single number like this is called **point estimation**; in the case at hand the statistic x−−x- is a **point estimate** of the parameter _μ_. The terminology arises because a single number corresponds to a single point on the number line.

A problem with a point estimate is that it gives no indication of how reliable the estimate is. In contrast, in this chapter we learn about **interval estimation**. In brief, in the case of estimating a population mean _μ_ we use a formula to compute from the data a number _E_, called the margin of error of the estimate, and form the interval \[x−−−E,x−−+E\].\[x-−E,x-+E\]. We do this in such a way that a certain proportion, say 95%, of all the intervals constructed from sample data by means of this formula contain the unknown parameter _μ_. Such an interval is called a **95%** confidence interval **for** _μ_.

Continuing with the example of the average height of 18-year-old men, suppose that the sample of 100 men mentioned above for which x−−=70.6x-=70.6 inches also had sample standard deviation _s_ = 1.7 inches. It then turns out that _E_ = 0.33 and we would state that we are 95% confident that the average height of all 18-year-old men is in the interval formed by 70.6±0.3370.6±0.33 inches, that is, the average is between 70.27 and 70.93 inches. If the sample statistics had come from a smaller sample, say a sample of 50 men, the lower reliability would show up in the 95% confidence interval being longer, hence less precise in its estimate. In this example the 95% confidence interval for the same sample statistics but with _n_ = 50 is 70.6±0.4770.6±0.47 inches, or from 70.13 to 71.07 inches.

### 7.1 Large Sample Estimation of a Population Mean

#### LEARNING OBJECTIVES

1. To become familiar with the concept of an interval estimate of the population mean.
2. To understand how to apply formulas for a confidence interval for a population mean.

The Central Limit Theorem says that, for large samples \(samples of size _n_ ≥ 30\), when viewed as a random variable the sample mean X−−X- is normally distributed with mean μX−−=μμX-=μ and standard deviation σX−−=σ/n−−√.σX-=σ∕n. The Empirical Rule says that we must go about two standard deviations from the mean to capture 95% of the values of X−−X- generated by sample after sample. A more precise distance based on the normality of X−−X- is 1.960 standard deviations, which is E=1.960σ/n−−√.E=1.960σ∕n.

The key idea in the construction of the 95% confidence interval is this, as illustrated in [Figure 7.1 "When Winged Dots Capture the Population Mean"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s11-estimation.html#fwk-shafer-ch07_s01_f01): because in sample after sample 95% of the values of X−−X- lie in the interval \[μ−E,μ+E\]\[μ−E,μ+E\], if we adjoin to each side of the point estimate x−−x- a “wing” of length _E_, 95% of the intervals formed by the winged dots contain _μ_. The 95% confidence interval is thus x−−±1.960σ/n−−√.x-±1.960σ∕n. For a different level of confidence, say 90% or 99%, the number 1.960 will change, but the idea is the same.

[Figure 7.2 "Computer Simulation of 40 95% Confidence Intervals for a Mean"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s11-01-large-sample-estimation-of-a-p.html) shows the intervals generated by a computer simulation of drawing 40 samples from a normally distributed population and constructing the 95% confidence interval for each one. We expect that about \(0.05\)\(40\)=2\(0.05\)\(40\)=2 of the intervals so constructed would fail to contain the population mean _μ_, and in this simulation two of the intervals, shown in red, do.

It is standard practice to identify the level of confidence in terms of the area αα in the two tails of the distribution of X−−X- when the middle part specified by the level of confidence is taken out. This is shown in [Figure 7.3](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s11-estimation.html#fwk-shafer-ch07_s01_f03), drawn for the general situation, and in [Figure 7.4](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s11-estimation.html#fwk-shafer-ch07_s01_f04), drawn for 95% confidence. Remember from [Section 5.4.1 "Tails of the Standard Normal Distribution"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/fwk-shafer-ch05_s04#fwk-shafer-ch05_s04_s01) in [Chapter 5 "Continuous Random Variables"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s09-continuous-random-variables.html) that the _z_-value that cuts off a right tail of area _c_ is denoted _zc_. Thus the number 1.960 in the example is z.025z.025, which is zα∕2zα∕2 for α=1−0.95=0.05.α=1−0.95=0.05.

Figure 7.3![](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/section_11/e3f246f42e1caa418685cbcb55e93279.jpg)

For 100\(1−α\)100\(1−α\)% confidence the area in each tail is α∕2.α∕2.

Figure 7.4![](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/section_11/9befc784764fb56426a1ba328be4bc98.jpg)

For 95% confidence the area in each tail is α∕2=0.025.α∕2=0.025.

The level of confidence can be any number between 0 and 100%, but the most common values are probably 90% \(α=0.10α=0.10\), 95% \(α=0.05α=0.05\), and 99% \(α=0.01α=0.01\).

Thus in general for a 100\(1−α\)100\(1−α\)% confidence interval, E=zα∕2\(σ/n−−√\)E=zα∕2\(σ∕n\), so the formula for the confidence interval is x−−±zα∕2\(σ/n−−√\).x-±zα∕2\(σ∕n\). While sometimes the population standard deviation _σ_ is known, typically it is not. If not, for _n_ ≥ 30 it is generally safe to approximate _σ_ by the sample standard deviation _s_.

#### Large Sample 100\(1−α\)%100\(1−α\)% Confidence Interval for a Population Mean

If _σ_ is known: x−−±zα∕2\(σn√\)x-±zα∕2σn

If _σ_ is unknown: x−−±zα∕2\(sn√\)x-±zα∕2sn

A sample is considered large when _n_ ≥ 30.

As mentioned earlier, the number E=zα∕2σ/n−−√E=zα∕2σ∕n or E=zα∕2s/n−−√E=zα∕2s∕n is called the _margin of error_ of the estimate.
