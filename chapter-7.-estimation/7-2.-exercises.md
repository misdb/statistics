## **2. APPLICATIONS**

1. City planners wish to estimate the mean lifetime of the most commonly planted trees in urban settings.

Assume a normal distribution of the number of shot in a 30-inch circle at 40 yards for this choke.

The mean and standard deviation of the sample are x−−=1120x-=1120 and _s_ = 215 words. Assuming that speaking vocabularies are normally distributed, construct an 80% confidence interval for the mean speaking vocabulary of all three-year-old children in this socioeconomic group.
7. A thread manufacturer tests a sample of eight lengths of a certain type of thread made of blended materials and obtains a mean tensile strength of 8.2 lb with standard deviation 0.06 lb. Assuming tensile strengths are normally distributed, construct a 90% confidence interval for the mean tensile strength of this thread.

## **3. ADDITIONAL EXERCISES**

1. Botanists studying attrition among saplings in new growth areas of forests diligently counted stems in six plots in five-year-old new growth areas, obtaining the following counts of stems per acre:9,4328,77311,0269,86810,53910,2479,43211,02610,5398,7739,86810,247

   Construct an 80% confidence interval for the mean number of stems per acre in all five-year-old new growth areas of forests. Assume that the number of stems per acre is normally distributed.

2. Nutritionists are investigating the efficacy of a diet plan designed to increase the caloric intake of elderly people. The increase in daily caloric intake in 12 individuals who are put on the plan is \(a minus sign signifies that calories consumed went down\):121188284−102−94259295226183152312167121284−94295183312188−102259226152167

   Construct a 99.8% confidence interval for the mean increase in caloric intake for all people who are put on this diet. Assume that population of differences in intake is normally distributed.

3. A machine for making precision cuts in dimension lumber produces studs with lengths that vary with standard deviation 0.003 inch. Five trial cuts are made to check the machine’s calibration. The mean length of the studs produced is 104.998 inches with sample standard deviation 0.004 inch. Construct a 99.5% confidence interval for the mean lengths of all studs cut by this machine. Assume lengths are normally distributed. Hint: Not all the numbers given in the problem are used.
4. The variation in time for a baked good to go through a conveyor oven at a large scale bakery has standard deviation 0.017 minute at every time setting. To check the bake time of the oven periodically four batches of goods are carefully timed. The recent check gave a mean of 27.2 minutes with sample standard deviation 0.012 minute. Construct a 99.8% confidence interval for the mean bake time of all batches baked in this oven. Assume bake times are normally distributed. Hint: Not all the numbers given in the problem are used.
5. Wildlife researchers tranquilized and weighed three adult male polar bears. The data \(in pounds\) are: 926, 742, 1,109. Assume the weights of all bears are normally distributed.
   1. Construct an 80% confidence interval for the mean weight of all adult male polar bears using these data.
   2. Convert the three weights in pounds to weights in kilograms using the conversion 1 lb = 0.453 kg \(so the first datum changes to \(926\)\(0.453\)=419\(926\)\(0.453\)=419\). Use the converted data to construct an 80% confidence interval for the mean weight of all adult male polar bears expressed in kilograms.
   3. Convert your answer in part \(a\) into kilograms directly and compare it to your answer in \(b\). This illustrates that if you construct a confidence interval in one system of units you can convert it directly into another system of units without having to convert all the data to the new units.
6. Wildlife researchers trapped and measured six adult male collared lemmings. The data \(in millimeters\) are: 104, 99, 112, 115, 96, 109. Assume the lengths of all lemmings are normally distributed.
   1. Construct a 90% confidence interval for the mean length of all adult male collared lemmings using these data.
   2. Convert the six lengths in millimeters to lengths in inches using the conversion 1 mm = 0.039 in \(so the first datum changes to \(104\)\(0.039\) = 4.06\). Use the converted data to construct a 90% confidence interval for the mean length of all adult male collared lemmings expressed in inches.
   3. Convert your answer in part \(a\) into inches directly and compare it to your answer in \(b\). This illustrates that if you construct a confidence interval in one system of units you can convert it directly into another system of units without having to convert all the data to the new units.
