# 7-3. Large Sample Estimation of a Population Proportion

Since from [Section 6.3 "The Sample Proportion"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/fwk-shafer-ch06_s03#fwk-shafer-ch06_s03) in [Chapter 6 "Sampling Distributions"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s10-sampling-distributions.html) we know the mean, standard deviation, and sampling distribution of the sample proportion $$\hat{p}$$ , the ideas of the previous two sections can be applied to produce a confidence interval for a population proportion. Here is the formula.

> lies wholly within the interval $$[0,1]$$ .

In actual practice the value of $$p$$ is not known, hence neither is $$σ_\hat{P}$$ . In that case we substitute the known quantity $$\hat{p}$$ for $$p$$ in making the check; this means checking that the interval

                                                  $$[ \hat{p}-3 \sqrt{  \frac{\hat{p}(1−\hat{p})}{n}}, \hat{p}+3 \sqrt{  \frac{\hat{p}(1−\hat{p})}{n}}]$$ 

lies wholly within the interval $$[0,1]$$ .

**EXAMPLE 7.** To estimate the proportion of students at a large college who are female, a random sample of 120 students is selected. There are 69 female students in the sample. Construct a 90% confidence interval for the proportion of all students at the college who are female.

**\[ Solution \]**

The proportion of students in the sample who are female is $$\hat {p}=69∕120=0.575$$ ****.

Confidence level 90% means that $$α=1−0.90=0.10$$, so $$α∕2=0.05$$ . From the last line of [Figure 12.3 "Critical Values of "](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s16-appendix.html) we obtain $$z_{0.05}=1.645$$ .

Thus $$\hat{p}±z_{α∕2} \sqrt{ \hat p (1−\hat p) / n }=0.575±1.645 \sqrt{ (0.575)(0.425) / 120 }=0.575±0.074 $$ .

One may be 90% confident that the true proportion of all students at the college who are female is contained in the interval $$(0.575−0.074,0.575+0.074)=(0.501,0.649)$$ .

* Using Rstat Package : `prob.ci()`

{% tab title="R Source" %}
```text
library(Rstat)

prob.ci(n=120, x=69, alp=0.10, dig=3)
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Result" %}
```text
> prob.ci(n=120, x=69, alp=0.10, dig=3)
## [0.575 ± 1.645×√(0.575×0.425/120)] = [0.575 ± 0.074] = [0.501, 0.649]
