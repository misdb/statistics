# 7-3. Large Sample Estimation of a Population Proportion

Since from [Section 6.3 "The Sample Proportion"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/fwk-shafer-ch06_s03#fwk-shafer-ch06_s03) in [Chapter 6 "Sampling Distributions"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s10-sampling-distributions.html) we know the mean, standard deviation, and sampling distribution of the sample proportion pˆp^, the ideas of the previous two sections can be applied to produce a confidence interval for a population proportion. Here is the formula.

#### Large Sample 100\(1−α\)%100\(1−α\)% Confidence Interval for a Population Proportion

pˆ±zα∕2pˆ\(1−pˆ\)n−−−−−−−−√p^±zα∕2p^\(1−p^\)n

A sample is large if the interval \[p−3 σPˆ, p+3 σPˆ\]\[p−3 σP^, p+3 σP^\] lies wholly within the interval \[0,1\].\[0,1\].

In actual practice the value of _p_ is not known, hence neither is σPˆ.σP^. In that case we substitute the known quantity pˆp^ for _p_ in making the check; this means checking that the interval\[pˆ−3 pˆ\(1−pˆ\)n−−−−−−−−√, pˆ+3 pˆ\(1−pˆ\)n−−−−−−−−√\]p^−3 p^\(1−p^\)n, p^+3 p^\(1−p^\)n

lies wholly within the interval \[0,1\].\[0,1\].

#### EXAMPLE 7

To estimate the proportion of students at a large college who are female, a random sample of 120 students is selected. There are 69 female students in the sample. Construct a 90% confidence interval for the proportion of all students at the college who are female.
