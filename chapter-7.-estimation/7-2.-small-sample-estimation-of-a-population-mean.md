# 7-2. Small Sample Estimation of a Population Mean

The confidence interval formulas in the previous section are based on the Central Limit Theorem, the statement that for large samples X−−X- is normally distributed with mean _μ_ and standard deviation σ/n−−√.σ∕n. When the population mean _μ_ is estimated with a small sample \(_n_ &lt; 30\), the Central Limit Theorem does not apply. In order to proceed we assume that the numerical population from which the sample is taken has a normal distribution to begin with. If this condition is satisfied then when the population standard deviation _σ_ is known the old formula x−−±zα∕2\(σ/n−−√\)x-±zα∕2\(σ∕n\) can still be used to construct a 100\(1−α\)100\(1−α\)% confidence interval for _μ_.

If the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size _n_ is small then when we substitute the sample standard deviation _s_ for _σ_ the normal approximation is no longer valid. The solution is to use a different distribution, called Student’s _t_-distribution **with** n−1n−1 degrees of freedom. Student’s _t_-distribution is very much like the standard normal distribution in that it is centered at 0 and has the same qualitative bell shape, but it has heavier tails than the standard normal distribution does, as indicated by [Figure 7.5 "Student’s "](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s11-estimation.html#fwk-shafer-ch07_s02_f05), in which the curve \(in brown\) that meets the dashed vertical line at the lowest point is the _t_-distribution with two degrees of freedom, the next curve \(in blue\) is the _t_-distribution with five degrees of freedom, and the thin curve \(in red\) is the standard normal distribution. As also indicated by the figure, as the sample size _n_ increases, Student’s _t_-distribution ever more closely resembles the standard normal distribution. Although there is a different _t_-distribution for every value of _n_, once the sample size is 30 or more it is typically acceptable to use the standard normal distribution instead, as we will always do in this text.

Figure 7.5 Student’s _t_-Distribution![](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/section_11/3435a692ad23c4d5cf2b42e6aa8f5191.jpg)

Just as the symbol _zc_ stands for the value that cuts off a right tail of area _c_ in the standard normal distribution, so the symbol _tc_ stands for the value that cuts off a right tail of area _c_ in the standard normal distribution. This gives us the following confidence interval formulas.

#### Small Sample 100\(1−α\)%100\(1−α\)% Confidence Interval for a Population Mean

If _σ_ is known: x−−±zα∕2\(σn√\)x-±zα∕2σn

If _σ_ is unknown: x−−±tα∕2\(sn√\)x-±tα∕2sn \(degrees of freedom df=n−1df=n−1\)

The population must be normally distributed.

A sample is considered small when _n_ &lt; 30.

To use the new formula we use the line in [Figure 12.3 "Critical Values of "](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s16-appendix.html) that corresponds to the relevant sample size.

#### EXAMPLE 5

A sample of size 15 drawn from a normally distributed population has sample mean 35 and sample standard deviation 14. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the population mean, and interpret its meaning.

Solution:



#### EXAMPLE 6

A random sample of 12 students from a large university yields mean GPA 2.71 with sample standard deviation 0.51. Construct a 90% confidence interval for the mean GPA of all students at the university. Assume that the numerical population of GPAs from which the sample is taken has a normal distribution.

Solution:
