## 3. Additional Exercises

**Ex 17.** Five laboratory mice with thymus leukemia are observed for a predetermined period of 500 days. After 500 days, four mice have died but the fifth one survives. The recorded survival times for the five mice are

2. Can you find the sample median for the data set? If so, find it. If not, why not?

```

where \* indicates that the mouse survived for at least the given number of days but the exact value of the observation is unknown.

1. Can you find the sample mean for the data set? If so, find it. If not, explain why not.
2. Can you find the sample median for the data set? If so, find it. If not, explain why not.
