**Ex 12.** The rate for renting a motor scooter for one day at a beach resort area is $25 plus 30 cents for each mile the scooter is driven. The total cost $$y$$ in dollars for renting a scooter and driving it _x_ miles is  
                                                                $$y=0.30x+25$$

2. A person intends to rent a scooter one day for a trip to an attraction 17 miles away. Assuming that the total distance the scooter is driven is 34 miles, predict the cost of the rental.
