# 10-5. Statistical Inferences

The parameter $$β_1$$ , the slope of the population regression line, is of primary importance in regression analysis because it gives the true rate of change in the mean $$E(y)$$ in response to a unit increase in the predictor variable $$x$$ . For every unit increase in _x_ the mean of the response variable $$y$$ changes by $$β_1$$ units, increasing if $$β_1>0$$ and decreasing if$$β_1 <0$$. We wish to construct confidence intervals for $$β_1$$ and test hypotheses about it.

### Confidence Intervals for $$β_1$$

The slope $$\hat{β_1}$$ of the least squares regression line is a point estimate of $$β_1$$. A confidence interval for $$β_1$$ is given by the following formula.

**\[ Solution \]**

The point estimate βˆ1β^1 of $$β_1$$ was computed in [Note 10.18 "Example 2"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/fwk-shafer-ch10_s04#fwk-shafer-ch10_s04_s02_n02) in [Section 10.4 "The Least Squares Regression Line"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s14-04-the-least-squares-regression-l.html) as βˆ1=0.34375.β^1=0.34375. In the same example SSxxSSxx was found to be SSxx=51.2.SSxx=51.2. The sum of the squared errors SSESSE was computed in [Note 10.23 "Example 4"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/fwk-shafer-ch10_s04#fwk-shafer-ch10_s04_s03_n02) in [Section 10.4 "The Least Squares Regression Line"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s14-04-the-least-squares-regression-l.html) as SSE=0.75.SSE=0.75. Thussε=SSEn−2−−−−−√=0.753−−−−√=0.50sε=SSEn−2=0.753=0.50

Confidence level 95% means α=1−0.95=0.05α=1−0.95=0.05 so α∕2=0.025.α∕2=0.025. From the row labeled df=3df=3 in [Figure 12.3 "Critical Values of "](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s16-appendix.html) we obtain t0.025=3.182.t0.025=3.182. Thereforeβˆ1±tα∕2sεSSxx−−−−√=0.34375±3.182\(0.5051.2−−−−√\)=0.34375±0.2223β^1±tα∕2sεSSxx=0.34375±3.1820.5051.2=0.34375±0.2223

which gives the interval \(0.1215,0.5661\).\(0.1215,0.5661\). We are 95% confident that the slope β1β1 of the population regression line is between 0.1215 and 0.5661.



EXAMPLE 7. Using the sample data in [Table 10.3 "Data on Age and Value of Used Automobiles of a Specific Make and Model"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/fwk-shafer-ch10_s04#fwk-shafer-ch10_s04_s02_t03) construct a 90% confidence interval for the slope $$β_1$$ of the population regression line relating age and value of the automobiles of [Note 10.19 "Example 3"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s14-04-the-least-squares-regression-l.html) in [Section 10.4 "The Least Squares Regression Line"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s14-04-the-least-squares-regression-l.html). Interpret the result in the context of the problem.

**\[ Solution \]**

The point estimate βˆ1β^1 of β1β1 was computed in [Note 10.19 "Example 3"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s14-04-the-least-squares-regression-l.html), as was SSxx.SSxx. Their values are βˆ1=−2.05β^1=−2.05 and SSxx=14.SSxx=14. The sum of the squared errors SSESSE was computed in [Note 10.24 "Example 5"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/fwk-shafer-ch10_s04#fwk-shafer-ch10_s04_s03_n03) in [Section 10.4 "The Least Squares Regression Line"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s14-04-the-least-squares-regression-l.html) as SSE=28.946.SSE=28.946. Thussε=SSEn−2−−−−−√=28.9468−−−−−−√=1.902169814sε=SSEn−2=28.9468=1.902169814

Confidence level 90% means α=1−0.90=0.10α=1−0.90=0.10 so α∕2=0.05.α∕2=0.05. From the row labeled df=8df=8 in [Figure 12.3 "Critical Values of "](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s16-appendix.html) we obtain t0.05=1.860.t0.05=1.860. Thereforeβˆ1±tα∕2sεSSxx−−−−√=−2.05±1.860\(1.90216981414−−√\)=−2.05±0.95β^1±tα∕2sεSSxx=−2.05±1.8601.90216981414=−2.05±0.95

which gives the interval \(−3.00,−1.10\).\(−3.00,−1.10\). We are 90% confident that the slope $$β_1$$ of the population regression line is between −3.00 and −1.10. In the context of the problem this means that for vehicles of this make and model between two and six years old we are 90% confident that for each additional year of age the average value of such a vehicle decreases by between $1,100 and $3,000.



### Testing Hypotheses About $$β_1$$

Hypotheses regarding $$β_1$$ can be tested using the same five-step procedures, either the critical value approach or the _p_-value approach, that were introduced in [Section 8.1 "The Elements of Hypothesis Testing"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/fwk-shafer-ch08_s01#fwk-shafer-ch08_s01) and [Section 8.3 "The Observed Significance of a Test"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/fwk-shafer-ch08_s03#fwk-shafer-ch08_s03) of [Chapter 8 "Testing Hypotheses"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s12-testing-hypotheses.html). The null hypothesis always has the form H0:β1=B0H0:β1=B0 where _B_0 is a number determined from the statement of the problem. The three forms of the alternative hypothesis, with the terminology for each case, are:

| Form of _Ha_ | Terminology |
| :--- | :--- |
| Ha:β1&lt;B0Ha:β1&lt;B0 | Left-tailed |
| Ha:β1&gt;B0Ha:β1&gt;B0 | Right-tailed |
| Ha:β1≠B0Ha:β1≠B0 | Two-tailed |

The value zero for _B_0 is of particular importance since in that case the null hypothesis is H0:β1=0H0:β1=0, which corresponds to the situation in which _x_ is not useful for predicting _y_. For if β1=0β1=0 then the population regression line is horizontal, so the mean E\(y\)E\(y\) is the same for every value of _x_ and we are just as well off in ignoring _x_ completely and approximating _y_ by its average value. Given two variables _x_ and _y_, the burden of proof is that _x_ is useful for predicting _y_, not that it is not. Thus the phrase “test whether _x_ is useful for prediction of _y_,” or words to that effect, means to perform the testH0:β1=0 vs. Ha:β1≠0H0:β1=0 vs. Ha:β1≠0

#### Standardized Test Statistic for Hypothesis Tests Concerning the Slope $$β_1$$ of the Population Regression Line

T=βˆ1−B0sε/SSxx−−−−√T=β^1−B0sε∕SSxx

The test statistic has Student’s _t_-distribution with df=n−2df=n−2 degrees of freedom.

The assumptions listed in [Section 10.3 "Modelling Linear Relationships with Randomness Present"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s14-03-modelling-linear-relationships.html) must hold.

#### EXAMPLE 9

A car salesman claims that automobiles between two and six years old of the make and model discussed in [Note 10.19 "Example 3"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s14-04-the-least-squares-regression-l.html) in [Section 10.4 "The Least Squares Regression Line"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s14-04-the-least-squares-regression-l.html) lose more than $1,100 in value each year. Test this claim at the 5% level of significance.
