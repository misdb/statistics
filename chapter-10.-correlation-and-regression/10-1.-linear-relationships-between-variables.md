# 10-1. Linear Relationships Between Variables

Our interest in this chapter is in situations in which we can associate to each element of a population or sample two measurements _x_ and _y_, particularly in the case that it is of interest to use the value of _x_ to predict the value of _y_. For example, the population could be the air in automobile garages, _x_ could be the electrical current produced by an electrochemical reaction taking place in a carbon monoxide meter, and _y_ the concentration of carbon monoxide in the air. In this chapter we will learn statistical methods for analyzing the relationship between variables _x_ and _y_ in this context.

A list of all the formulas that appear anywhere in this chapter are collected in the last section for ease of reference.

### 10.1 Linear Relationships Between Variables

#### LEARNING OBJECTIVE

1. To learn what it means for two variables to exhibit a relationship that is close to linear but which contains an element of randomness.

The following table gives examples of the kinds of pairs of variables which could be of interest from a statistical point of view.

| _x_ | _y_ |
| :--- | :--- |
| Predictor or independent variable | Response or dependent variable |
| Temperature in degrees Celsius | Temperature in degrees Fahrenheit |
| Area of a house \(sq.ft.\) | Value of the house |
| Age of a particular make and model car | Resale value of the car |
| Amount spent by a business on advertising in a year | Revenue received that year |
| Height of a 25-year-old man | Weight of the man |

The first line in the table is different from all the rest because in that case and no other the relationship between the variables is **deterministic**: once the value of _x_ is known the value of _y_ is completely determined. In fact there is a formula for _y_ in terms of _x_: y=95x+32.y=95x+32. Choosing several values for _x_ and computing the corresponding value for _y_ for each one using the formula gives the tablexy−40−40−155032206850122x−40−1502050y−4053268122

We can plot these data by choosing a pair of perpendicular lines in the plane, called the coordinate axes, as shown in [Figure 10.1 "Plot of Celsius and Fahrenheit Temperature Pairs"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s14-correlation-and-regression.html#fwk-shafer-ch10_s01_f01). Then to each pair of numbers in the table we associate a unique point in the plane, the point that lies _x_ units to the right of the vertical axis \(to the left if x&lt;0x&lt;0\) and _y_ units above the horizontal axis \(below if y&lt;0y&lt;0\). The relationship between _x_ and _y_ is called a **linear relationship** because the points so plotted all lie on a single straight line. The number 9595 in the equation y=95x+32y=95x+32 is the **slope** of the line, and measures its steepness. It describes how _y_ changes in response to a change in _x_: if _x_ increases by 1 unit then _y_ increases \(since 9595 is positive\) by 9595 unit. If the slope had been negative then _y_ would have decreased in response to an increase in _x_. The number 32 in the formula y=95x+32y=95x+32 is the _y_**-intercept** of the line; it identifies where the line crosses the _y_-axis. You may recall from an earlier course that every non-vertical line in the plane is described by an equation of the form y=mx+by=mx+b, where _m_ is the slope of the line and _b_ is its _y_-intercept.

The relationship between _x_ and _y_ in the temperature example is deterministic because once the value of _x_ is known, the value of _y_ is completely determined. In contrast, all the other relationships listed in the table above have an element of randomness in them. Consider the relationship described in the last line of the table, the height _x_ of a man aged 25 and his weight _y_. If we were to randomly select several 25-year-old men and measure the height and weight of each one, we might obtain a collection of \(x,y\)\(x,y\) pairs something like this:\(68,151\)\(72,163\)\(69,146\)\(72,180\)\(70,157\)\(73,170\)\(70,164\)\(73,175\)\(71,171\)\(74,178\)\(72,160\)\(75,188\)\(68,151\)\(69,146\)\(70,157\)\(70,164\)\(71,171\)\(72,160\)\(72,163\)\(72,180\)\(73,170\)\(73,175\)\(74,178\)\(75,188\)

A plot of these data is shown in [Figure 10.2 "Plot of Height and Weight Pairs"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s14-01-linear-relationships-between-v.html). Such a plot is called a **scatter diagram** or **scatter plot**. Looking at the plot it is evident that there exists a linear relationship between height _x_ and weight _y_, but not a perfect one. The points appear to be following a line, but not exactly. There is an element of randomness present.

In this chapter we will analyze situations in which variables _x_ and _y_ exhibit such a linear relationship with randomness. The level of randomness will vary from situation to situation. In the introductory example connecting an electric current and the level of carbon monoxide in air, the relationship is almost perfect. In other situations, such as the height and weights of individuals, the connection between the two variables involves a high degree of randomness. In the next section we will see how to quantify the strength of the linear relationship between two variables.
