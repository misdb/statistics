# 10-2. The Linear Correlation Coefficient

[Figure 10.3 "Linear Relationships of Varying Strengths"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s14-correlation-and-regression.html#fwk-shafer-ch10_s02_f01) illustrates linear relationships between two variables _x_ and _y_ of varying strengths. It is visually apparent that in the situation in panel \(a\), _x_ could serve as a useful predictor of _y_, it would be less useful in the situation illustrated in panel \(b\), and in the situation of panel \(c\) the linear relationship is so weak as to be practically nonexistent. The _linear correlation coefficient_ is a number computed directly from the data that measures the strength of the linear relationship between the two variables _x_ and  _y_.

#### Definition

_The_ linear correlation coefficient _for a collection of_ _n_ _pairs_ \(x,y\)\(x,y\) _of numbers in a sample is the number_ _r_ _given by the formula_r=SSxySSxx⋅SSyy−−−−−−−−−√r=SSxySSxx·SSyy

_where_SSxx=Σx2−1n\(Σx\)2, SSxy=Σxy−1n\(Σx\)\(Σy\), SSyy=Σy2−1n\(Σy\)2SSxx=Σx2−1n\(Σx\)2, SSxy=Σxy−1n\(Σx\)\(Σy\), SSyy=Σy2−1n\(Σy\)2

The linear correlation coefficient has the following properties, illustrated in [Figure 10.4 "Linear Correlation Coefficient "](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s14-02-the-linear-correlation-coeffic.html):

1. The value of _r_ lies between −1 and 1, inclusive.
2. The sign of _r_ indicates the direction of the linear relationship between _x_ and _y_:
   1. If r&lt;0r&lt;0 then _y_ tends to decrease as _x_ is increased.
   2. If r&gt;0r&gt;0 then _y_ tends to increase as _x_ is increased.
3. The size of \|_r_\| indicates the strength of the linear relationship between _x_ and _y_:
   1. If \|_r_\| is near 1 \(that is, if _r_ is near either 1 or −1\) then the linear relationship between _x_ and _y_ is strong.
   2. If \|_r_\| is near 0 \(that is, if _r_ is near 0 and of either sign\) then the linear relationship between _x_ and _y_ is weak.

Pay particular attention to panel \(f\) in [Figure 10.4 "Linear Correlation Coefficient "](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s14-02-the-linear-correlation-coeffic.html). It shows a perfectly deterministic relationship between _x_ and _y_, but r=0r=0 because the relationship is not linear. \(In this particular case the points lie on the top half of a circle.\)
