## **3. ADDITIONAL EXERCISES**

1. Verify that no matter what the data are, the least squares regression line always passes through the point with coordinates \(x−−,y–\).\(x-,y-\). Hint: Find the predicted value of _y_ when x=x−−.x=x-.
2. In Exercise 1 you computed the least squares regression line for the data in Exercise 1 of [Section 10.2 "The Linear Correlation Coefficient"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s14-02-the-linear-correlation-coeffic.html).

   2. Interchanging _x_ and _y_ corresponds geometrically to reflecting the scatter plot in a 45-degree line. Reflecting the regression line for the original data the same way gives a line with the equation yˆ=1.346x−3.600.y^=1.346x−3.600. Is this the equation that you got in part \(a\)? Can you figure out why not? Hint: Think about how _x_ and _y_ are treated differently geometrically in the computation of the goodness of fit.
   3. Compute SSESSE for each line and see if they fit the same, or if one fits the data better than the other.
