## **3. ADDITIONAL EXERCISES**

1. Verify that no matter what the data are, the least squares regression line always passes through the point with coordinates $$(\bar{x}, \bar{y})$$. Hint: Find the predicted value of $$y$$ when $$x=\bar{x}$$ .
2. In Exercise 1 you computed the least squares regression line for the data in Exercise 1 of [Section 10.2 "The Linear Correlation Coefficient"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s14-02-the-linear-correlation-coeffic.html).
   1. Reverse the roles of $$x $$ and $$y$$ and compute the least squares regression line for the new data set                                      x   2   4   6   5   9                                      y   0   1   3   5   8
   2. Interchanging _x_ and _y_ corresponds geometrically to reflecting the scatter plot in a 45-degree line. Reflecting the regression line for the original data the same way gives a line with the equation $$\hat{y}=1.346x−3.600$$ . Is this the equation that you got in part \(a\)? Can you figure out why not? Hint: Think about how $$x$$ and $$y$$ are treated differently geometrically in the computation of the goodness of fit.
   3. Compute $$SSE$$ for each line and see if they fit the same, or if one fits the data better than the other.
