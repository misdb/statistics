# 10-3. Exercises

## EXERCISES

**Ex 1.** State the three assumptions that are the basis for the Simple Linear Regression Model.

**Ex 2.** The Simple Linear Regression Model is summarized by the equation  
 $$y=β_1x+β_0+ε$$ 

Identify the deterministic part and the random part.

**Ex 3.** Is the number β1β1 in the equation $$y=β_1x+β_0$$ a statistic or a population parameter? Explain.

**Ex 4.** Is the number $$σ$$ in the Simple Linear Regression Model a statistic or a population parameter? Explain.

**Ex 5.** Describe what to look for in a scatter diagram in order to check that the assumptions of the Simple Linear Regression Model are true.

**Ex 6.** True or false: the assumptions of the Simple Linear Regression Model must hold exactly in order for the procedures and analysis developed in this chapter to be useful.
