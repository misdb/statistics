# 10-3. Exercises

## EXERCISES

1. State the three assumptions that are the basis for the Simple Linear Regression Model.
2. The Simple Linear Regression Model is summarized by the equation  
    $$y=β_1x+β_0+ε$$ 

   Identify the deterministic part and the random part.

3. Is the number β1β1 in the equation $$y=β_1x+β_0$$ a statistic or a population parameter? Explain.
4. Is the number $$σ$$ in the Simple Linear Regression Model a statistic or a population parameter? Explain.
5. Describe what to look for in a scatter diagram in order to check that the assumptions of the Simple Linear Regression Model are true.
6. True or false: the assumptions of the Simple Linear Regression Model must hold exactly in order for the procedures and analysis developed in this chapter to be useful.
