# 10-6. The Coefficient of Determination

If the scatter diagram of a set of \(x,y\)\(x,y\) pairs shows neither an upward or downward trend, then the horizontal line yˆ=y–y^=y- fits it well, as illustrated in [Figure 10.11](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s14-correlation-and-regression.html#fwk-shafer-ch10_s06_f01). The lack of any upward or downward trend means that when an element of the population is selected at random, knowing the value of the measurement _x_ for that element is not helpful in predicting the value of the measurement _y_.

The line yˆ=y–y^=y- fits the scatter diagram well.

If the scatter diagram shows a linear trend upward or downward then it is useful to compute the least squares regression line yˆ=βˆ1x+βˆ0y^=β^1x+β^0 and use it in predicting _y_. [Figure 10.12 "Same Scatter Diagram with Two Approximating Lines"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s14-correlation-and-regression.html#fwk-shafer-ch10_s06_f02) illustrates this. In each panel we have plotted the height and weight data of [Section 10.1 "Linear Relationships Between Variables"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/fwk-shafer-ch10_s01#fwk-shafer-ch10_s01). This is the same scatter plot as [Figure 10.2 "Plot of Height and Weight Pairs"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/fwk-shafer-ch10_s01#fwk-shafer-ch10_s01_f02), with the average value line yˆ=y–y^=y- superimposed on it in the left panel and the least squares regression line imposed on it in the right panel. The errors are indicated graphically by the vertical line segments.

The sum of the squared errors computed for the regression line, SSESSE, is smaller than the sum of the squared errors computed for any other line. In particular it is less than the sum of the squared errors computed using the line yˆ=y–y^=y-, which sum is actually the number SSyySSyy that we have seen several times already. A measure of how useful it is to use the regression equation for prediction of _y_ is how much smaller SSESSE is than SSyy.SSyy. In particular, the _proportion_ of the sum of the squared errors for the line yˆ=y–y^=y- that is eliminated by going over to the least squares regression line isSSyy−SSESSyy=SSyySSyy−SSESSyy=1−SSESSyySSyy−SSESSyy=SSyySSyy−SSESSyy=1−SSESSyy

We can think of SSE/SSyySSE∕SSyy as the proportion of the variability in _y_ that cannot be accounted for by the linear relationship between _x_ and _y_, since it is still there even when _x_ is taken into account in the best way possible \(using the least squares regression line; remember that SSESSE is the smallest the sum of the squared errors can be for any line\). Seen in this light, the coefficient of determination, the complementary proportion of the variability in _y_, is the proportion of the variability in all the _y_ measurements that is accounted for by the linear relationship between _x_ and _y_.

In the context of linear regression the coefficient of determination is always the square of the correlation coefficient _r_ discussed in [Section 10.2 "The Linear Correlation Coefficient"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s14-02-the-linear-correlation-coeffic.html). Thus the coefficient of determination is denoted _r_2, and we have two additional formulas for computing it.

#### Definition

_The_ coefficient of determination _of a collection of_ \(x,y\)\(x,y\) _pairs is the number_ _r_2 _computed by any of the following three expressions:_r2=SSyy−SSESSyy=SS2xySSxxSSyy=βˆ1SSxySSyyr2=SSyy−SSESSyy=SSxy2SSxxSSyy=β^1SSxySSyy

_It measures the proportion of the variability in_ _y_ _that is accounted for by the linear relationship between_ _x_ _and_ _y_.

If the correlation coefficient _r_ is already known then the coefficient of determination can be computed simply by squaring _r_, as the notation indicates, r2=\(r\)2.r2=\(r\)2.

#### EXAMPLE 10

The value of used vehicles of the make and model discussed in [Note 10.19 "Example 3"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s14-04-the-least-squares-regression-l.html) in [Section 10.4 "The Least Squares Regression Line"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s14-04-the-least-squares-regression-l.html) varies widely. The most expensive automobile in the sample in [Table 10.3 "Data on Age and Value of Used Automobiles of a Specific Make and Model"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/fwk-shafer-ch10_s04#fwk-shafer-ch10_s04_s02_t03) has value $30,500, which is nearly half again as much as the least expensive one, which is worth $20,400. Find the proportion of the variability in value that is accounted for by the linear relationship between age and value.

Solution:



#### EXAMPLE 11
