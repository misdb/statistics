3. Changing the units of measurement on two variables _x_ and _y_ should not change the linear correlation coefficient. Moreover, most change of units amount to simply multiplying one unit by the other \(for example, 1 foot = 12 inches\).

4. Refer to the previous exercise. Multiply each _x_ value in the table in Exercise 2 by two, multiply each _y_ value by three, and compute the linear correlation coefficient for the new data set. Compare the new value of _r_ to the one for the original data.
5. Reversing the roles of _x_ and _y_ in the data set of Exercise 1 produces the data setxy2041635598x24659y01358

   Compute the linear correlation coefficient of the new set of data and compare it to what you got in Exercise 1.
