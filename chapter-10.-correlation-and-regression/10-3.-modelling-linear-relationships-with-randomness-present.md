# 10-3. Modelling Linear Relationships with Randomness Present

In this chapter we are dealing with a population for which we can associate to each element two measurements, _x_ and _y_. We are interested in situations in which the value of _x_ can be used to draw conclusions about the value of _y_, such as predicting the resale value _y_ of a residential house based on its size _x_. Since the relationship between _x_ and _y_ is not deterministic, statistical procedures must be applied. For any statistical procedures, given in this book or elsewhere, the associated formulas are valid only under specific assumptions. The set of assumptions in simple linear regression are a mathematical description of the relationship between _x_ and _y_. Such a set of assumptions is known as a **model**.

For each fixed value of _x_ a sub-population of the full population is determined, such as the collection of all houses with 2,100 square feet of living space. For each element of that sub-population there is a measurement _y_, such as the value of any 2,100-square-foot house. Let E\(y\)E\(y\) denote the mean of all the _y_-values for each particular value of _x_. E\(y\)E\(y\) can change from _x_-value to _x_-value, such as the mean value of all 2,100-square-foot houses, the \(different\) mean value for all 2,500-square foot-houses, and so on.

Our first assumption is that the relationship between _x_ and the mean of the _y_-values in the sub-population determined by _x_ is linear. This means that there exist numbers β1β1 and β0β0 such thatE\(y\)=β1x+β0E\(y\)=β1x+β0

This linear relationship is the reason for the word “linear” in “simple linear regression” below. \(The word “simple” means that _y_ depends on only one other variable and not two or more.\)

Our next assumption is that for each value of _x_ the _y_-values scatter about the mean E\(y\)E\(y\) according to a normal distribution centered at E\(y\)E\(y\) and with a standard deviation _σ_ that is the same for every value of _x_. This is the same as saying that there exists a normally distributed random variable _ε_ with mean 0 and standard deviation _σ_ so that the relationship between _x_ and _y_ in the whole population isy=β1x+β0+εy=β1x+β0+ε

Our last assumption is that the random deviations associated with different observations are independent.

In summary, the model is:

#### Simple Linear Regression Model

For each point \(x,y\)\(x,y\) in data set the _y_-value is an independent observation ofy=β1x+β0+εy=β1x+β0+ε

where β1β1 and β0β0 are fixed parameters and _ε_ is a normally distributed random variable with mean 0 and an unknown standard deviation _σ_.

The line with equation y=β1x+β0y=β1x+β0 is called the population regression line.

[Figure 10.5 "The Simple Linear Model Concept"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s14-03-modelling-linear-relationships.html) illustrates the model. The symbols N\(μ,σ2\)N\(μ,σ2\) denote a normal distribution with mean _μ_ and variance σ2σ2, hence standard deviation _σ_.

It is conceptually important to view the model as a sum of two parts:y=β1x+β0+εy=β1x+β0+ε

1. **Deterministic Part.** The first part β1x+β0β1x+β0 is the equation that describes the trend in _y_ as _x_ increases. The line that we seem to see when we look at the scatter diagram is an approximation of the line y=β1x+β0.y=β1x+β0. There is nothing random in this part, and therefore it is called the _deterministic_ part of the model.
2. **Random Part.** The second part _ε_ is a random variable, often called the _error_ term or the _noise_. This part explains why the actual observed values of _y_ are not exactly on but fluctuate near a line. Information about this term is important since only when one knows how much noise there is in the data can one know how trustworthy the detected trend is.

There are three parameters in this model: β0β0, β1β1, and _σ_. Each has an important interpretation, particularly β1β1 and _σ_. The slope parameter β1β1 represents the expected change in _y_ brought about by a unit increase in _x_. The standard deviation _σ_ represents the magnitude of the noise in the data.

There are procedures for checking the validity of the three assumptions, but for us it will be sufficient to visually verify the linear trend in the data. If the data set is large then the points in the scatter diagram will form a band about an apparent straight line. The normality of _ε_ with a constant standard deviation corresponds graphically to the band being of roughly constant width, and with most points concentrated near the middle of the band.

Fortunately, the three assumptions do not need to hold exactly in order for the procedures and analysis developed in this chapter to be useful.
