# 10-7. Estimation and Prediction

Consider the following pairs of problems, in the context of [Note 10.19 "Example 3"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s14-04-the-least-squares-regression-l.html) in [Section 10.4 "The Least Squares Regression Line"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s14-04-the-least-squares-regression-l.html), the automobile age and value example.

1. 1. Estimate the average value of all four-year-old automobiles of this make and model.
   2. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the average value of all four-year-old automobiles of this make and model.
2. 1. Shylock intends to buy a four-year-old automobile of this make and model next week. Predict the value of the first such automobile that he encounters.
   2. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the value of the first such automobile that he encounters.

The method of solution and answer to the first question in each pair, \(1a\) and \(2a\), are the same. When we set _x_ equal to 4 in the least squares regression equation yˆ=−2.05x+32.83y^=−2.05x+32.83 that was computed in part \(c\) of [Note 10.19 "Example 3"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s14-04-the-least-squares-regression-l.html) in [Section 10.4 "The Least Squares Regression Line"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s14-04-the-least-squares-regression-l.html), the number returned,yˆ=−2.05\(4\)+32.83=24.63y^=−2.05\(4\)+32.83=24.63

which corresponds to value $24,630, is an estimate of precisely the number sought in question \(1a\): the mean E\(y\)E\(y\) of all _y_ values when _x_ = 4. Since nothing is known about the first four-year-old automobile of this make and model that Shylock will encounter, our best guess as to its value is the mean value E\(y\)E\(y\) of all such automobiles, the number 24.63 or $24,630, computed in the same way.

The answers to the second part of each question differ. In question \(1b\) we are trying to estimate a population parameter: the mean of the all the _y_-values in the sub-population picked out by the value _x_ = 4, that is, the average value of all four-year-old automobiles. In question \(2b\), however, we are not trying to capture a fixed parameter, but the value of the random variable _y_ in one trial of an experiment: examine the first four-year-old car Shylock encounters. In the first case we seek to construct a confidence interval in the same sense that we have done before. In the second case the situation is different, and the interval constructed has a different name, prediction interval. In the second case we are trying to “predict” where a the value of a random variable will take its value.

#### 100\(1−α\)%100\(1−α\)% Confidence Interval for the Mean Value of _y_ at x=xpx=xp

yˆp±tα∕2 sε 1n+\(xp−x−−\)2SSxx−−−−−−−−−−−−√y^p±tα∕2 sε 1n+\(xp−x-\)2SSxx

where

1. _xp_ is a particular value of _x_ that lies in the range of _x_-values in the sample data set used to construct the least squares regression line;
2. yˆpy^p is the numerical value obtained when the least square regression equation is evaluated at x=xpx=xp; and
3. the number of degrees of freedom for tα∕2tα∕2 is df=n−2.df=n−2.

The assumptions listed in [Section 10.3 "Modelling Linear Relationships with Randomness Present"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s14-03-modelling-linear-relationships.html) must hold.

The formula for the prediction interval is identical except for the presence of the number 1 underneath the square root sign. This means that the prediction interval is always wider than the confidence interval at the same confidence level and value of _x_. In practice the presence of the number 1 tends to make it much wider.

2. yˆpy^p is the numerical value obtained when the least square regression equation is evaluated at x=xpx=xp; and
3. the number of degrees of freedom for tα∕2tα∕2 is df=n−2.df=n−2.
