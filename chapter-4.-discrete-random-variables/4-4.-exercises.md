# 4-4. Exercises

**EXERCISE 1.** A company \(the producer\) supplies microprocessors to a manufacturer \(the consumer\) of electronic equipment. The microprocessors are supplied in batches of 50. The consumer regards a batch as acceptable provided that there are not more than 5 defective microprocessors in the batch. Rather than test all of the microprocessors in the batch, 10 are selected at random and tested. 

1. Find the probability that out of a sample of 10, d = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are defective when there are actually 5 defective microprocessors in the batch. 

2. Suppose that the consumer will accept the batch provided that not more than m defectives are found in the sample of 10.

              a\) Find the probability that the batch is accepted when there are 5 defectives in the batch. 

              b\) Find the probability that the batch is rejected when there are 3 defectives in the batch.

**\[ Solution \]**

    ****$$P(X=d) = \frac {_{45}C_{10-d} * _{5} C _{d}} {_{50} C _{10} } $$ 

1. $$P(X=0)≈ 0.311, P(X=1)≈0.431$$  $$P(X=2) ≈ 0.210, P(X=3) ≈0.044$$   $$P(X=4) ≈0.004, P(X=5) ≈0.0001$$ 
2.  a\) $$D =5,$$ $$P(accept \space batch \space with \space 5 \space defects) = $$   
         $$  $$$$\Sigma  P(X=d) = \Sigma \frac {_{45}C_{10-d} * _{5} C _{d}} {_{50} C _{10} } $$  ,     $$m ≤ 5$$      
    b\) $$D =3,$$ $$P(reject \space batch \space with \space 3 \space defects) = $$   
          $$1- \Sigma  P(X=d) = 1- \Sigma \frac {_{45}C_{10-d} * _{5} C _{d}} {_{50} C _{10} } $$  ,    $$m ≤ 3$$ 

  
       

**EXERCISE 2.**  A company buys batches of n components. Before a batch is accepted, m of the components are selected at random from the batch and tested. The batch is rejected if more than d components in the sample are found to be below standard. \(a\) Find the probability that a batch which actually contains six below-standard components is rejected when n = 20, m = 5 and d = 1. \(b\) Find the probability that a batch which actually contains nine below-standard components is rejected when n = 30, m = 10 and d = 1.
