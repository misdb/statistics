# 4-9. Negative Hypergeometric Distribution

6개의 흰 공, 4개의 검은 공이 든 상자에서 공을 하나씩 꺼낼 때, 흰 공을 꺼내는 것을 '성공'이라고 한다면, 흰 공을 처음 꺼내기 전 검은 공을 꺼낸 횟수를 확률변수 $$X$$라 할 때, 이 확률변수를 'Negative Hypergeometric random variable' 이라고 한다.

52장의 플레잉 카드를 고루 섞고, 한 장씩 나눠준다고 생각해보. 여기서 '에이스' 카드가 나오면 성공입이다. 만약 7번째에서 나눠준 카드가 '에이스'카드 였다면, 이 이전에 나눠줬던 6개의 카드들은 'Negative  Hypergeometric Distribution'을 따르는 것이다.

**EXAMPLE 28.**  Suppose an urn contains 4 red and 10 blue balls and that balls are drawn one after another from this urn until a red ball is obtained. What is the probability that exactly six balls are drawn?

**\[ Solution \]**

\*\*\*\*$$P(BBBBBR) = P(5 \space B \space Balls \space in \space 5 \space Draws) \times P(6^{th} \space Ball \space is \space R \space given \space 5 \space B \space Removed)$$   
                                 ****$$= \frac{ \binom{10}{5}  \binom{4}{0} }{ \binom{14}{5} } \times \frac {4}{14-5} = \frac{252}{2002}  \times \frac {4}{9} \doteq 0.0559$$ .



This example is like "_waiting for the first success in sampling without replacement_" with success being obtaining a red ball. 

Recall that in _sampling with replacement_ the distribution analogous to this was the **Geometric distribution**, a special case of the _Negative Binomial distribution_.



**EXAMPLE 29.** A statistics department has purchased 24 calculators of which 4 are defective. Calculators are selected one-after-another without replacement and tested. What is the probability that the second calculator found to be defective is the eighth calculator selected?

**\[ Solution \]** 

$$P(1 \space defective \space in \space 7 \space then \space 1 \space more \space defective) $$  
     $$= P(6 \space Good \space and \space 1 \space Defective \space in \space 7 \space draws) \times P(8^{th} \space Ball \space is \space Defective \space given \space 17 \space  left)$$   
     $$= \frac {\binom {20 }{6 } \binom {4 }{1}} { \binom {24} {7}} \times \frac{3}{17} = \frac{155,040 }{346,104 } \times \frac{3}{17} \doteq 0.079051$$ .



In the above two examples, **the final selection must be a success**. The selections before this one simply involve a _Hypergeometric situation_ involving one fewer selection than the total number and one fewer success than the number for which the procedure is waiting.
