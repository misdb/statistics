1. If a carrier \(not known to be such, of course\) is boarded with three other dogs, what is the probability that at least one of the three healthy dogs will develop kennel cough?
2. If a carrier is boarded with four other dogs, what is the probability that at least one of the four healthy dogs will develop kennel cough?
3. The pattern evident from parts \(a\) and \(b\) is that if $$K+1$$ dogs are boarded together, one a carrier and $$K$$ healthy dogs, then the probability that at least one of the healthy dogs will develop kennel cough is $$P(X≥1)=1−(0.992)^K$$ , where $$X$$ is the binomial random variable that counts the number of healthy dogs that develop the condition. Experiment with different values of $$K$$ in this formula to find the maximum number $$K+1$$ of dogs that a kennel owner can board together so that if one of the dogs has the condition, the chance that another dog will be infected is less than 0.05.

**Ex 32.** Investigators need to determine which of 600 adults have a medical condition that affects 2% of the adult population. A blood sample is taken from each of the individuals.

1. Show that the expected number of diseased individuals in the group of 600 is 12 individuals.
2. Instead of testing all 600 blood samples to find the expected 12 diseased individuals, investigators group the samples into 60 groups of 10 each, mix a little of the blood from each of the 10 samples in each group, and test each of the 60 mixtures. Show that the probability that any such mixture will contain the blood of at least one diseased person, hence test positive, is about 0.18.
3. Based on the result in \(b\), show that the expected number of mixtures that test positive is about 11. \(Supposing that indeed 11 of the 60 mixtures test positive, then we know that none of the 490 persons whose blood was in the remaining 49 samples that tested negative has the disease. We have eliminated 490 persons from our search while performing only 60 tests.\)
