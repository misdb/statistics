# 4-2. Probability Distributions for Discrete Random Variables

## 1. Probability Distributions

* _The_ **probability distribution** _of a discrete random variable_ _X_ _is a list of each possible **value** of_ _X_ _together with the **probability** that_ _X_ _takes that value in one trial of the experiment._



* The probabilities in the probability distribution of a random variable _X_ must satisfy the following two conditions:

1. Each probability $$P(x)$$ must be between 0 and 1: $$0≤P(x)≤1$$ .
2. The sum of all the probabilities is 1 : $$ΣP(x)=1.$$ 



**EXAMPLE 1.** A fair coin is tossed twice. Let _X_ be the number of heads that are observed.

1. Construct the probability distribution of _X_.
2. Find the probability that at least one head is observed.

**\[ Solution \]**

**EXAMPLE 2.** A pair of fair dice is rolled. Let _X_ denote the sum of the number of dots on the top faces.

1. Construct the probability distribution of _X_.
2. Find _P_\(_X_ ≥ 9\).
3. Find the probability that _X_ takes an even value.

## The Mean and Standard Deviation of a Discrete Random Variable

* _The_ **mean** _\(also called the_ **expected value**_\) of a discrete random variable_ _X_ _is the number_ 

                                                    __$$μ=E(X)=Σx P(x)$$ 

The mean of a random variable may be interpreted as the average of the values assumed by the random variable in repeated trials of the experiment.

**EXAMPLE 3.** Find the mean of the discrete random variable _X_ whose probability distribution is

```text
x       -2    1    2  3.5
P(x)  0.21 0.34 0.24 0.21
```

**\[ Solution \]**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="R Code" %}
```text
x <- c(-2, 1, 2, 3.5)
px <- c(0.21, 0.34, 0.24, 0.21)

mean <- sum(x * px) ; mean
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="mean" %}
```text
> mean <- sum(x * px) ; mean

**EXAMPLE 4.** A service organization in a large town organizes a raffle each month. One thousand raffle tickets are sold for $1 each. Each has an equal chance of winning. First prize is $300, second prize is $200, and third prize is $100. Let _X_ denote the net gain from the purchase of one ticket.

1. Construct the probability distribution of _X_.
2. Find the probability of winning any money in the purchase of one ticket.
3. Find the expected value of _X_, and interpret its meaning.

**\[ Solution \]**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="R Code" %}
```text
x <- c(299, 199, 99, -1)
px <- c(0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.997)

# 2.
sum(px[1:3])

# 3.
sum(x * px)
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="2. Winning Prob." %}
```text
> # 2.
> sum(px[1:3])
[1] 0.003
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="3. Expected Value" %}
```text
> # 3.
> sum(x * px)
[1] -0.4
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

**EXAMPLE 5.** A life insurance company will sell a $200,000 one-year term life insurance policy to an individual in a particular risk group for a premium of $195. Find the expected value to the company of a single policy if a person in this risk group has a 99.97% chance of surviving one year.

**\[ Solution \]**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="R Code" %}
```text
x <- c(195, -199805)
px <- c(0.9997, 0.0003)

# 2.
sum(x * px)
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Expected Value" %}
```text
> # 2.
> sum(x * px)
[1] 135
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

* _The_ **variance**, $$σ^2$$ _, of a discrete random variable_ _X_ _is the number_                                        $$σ^2=Σ(x−μ)^2 P(x)$$  _which by algebra is equivalent to the formula_                                      $$σ^2=  Σ(x^2* P(x))−μ^2$$ .

\_\_

* _The_ **standard deviation**, $$σ$$ , _of a discrete random variable_ _X_ _is the square root of its variance, hence is given by the formulas_

                           __$$σ=\sqrt{Σ(x−μ)^2 P(x)} =  \sqrt{[Σx^2 P(x)] − μ^2}$$   


**EXAMPLE 6.** A discrete random variable _X_ has the following probability distribution:

```text
x      -1    0  1    4
P(x)  0.2  0.5  a  0.1
```

Compute each of the following quantities.

1. _a_.
2. $$P(0)$$ 
3. $$P(X > 0)$$ .
4. $$P(X ≥ 0)$$ .
5. $$P(X≤−2)$$ .
6. The mean $$ μ$$ of _X_.
7. The variance $$σ^2$$ of _X_.
8. The standard deviation $$σ $$ of _X_.

a <- 1 - sum(0.2, 0.5, 0.1); a
x <- c(-1, 0, 1, 4)

# 6.
