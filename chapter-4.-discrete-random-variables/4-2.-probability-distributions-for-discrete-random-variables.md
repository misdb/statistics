# 4-2. Probability Distributions for Discrete Random Variables

## 1. Probability Distributions

* _The_ **probability distribution** _of a discrete random variable_ _X_ _is a list of each possible **value** of_ _X_ _together with the **probability** that_ _X_ _takes that value in one trial of the experiment._



* The probabilities in the probability distribution of a random variable _X_ must satisfy the following two conditions:

1. Each probability $$P(x)$$ must be between 0 and 1: $$0≤P(x)≤1$$ .
2. The sum of all the probabilities is 1 : $$ΣP(x)=1.$$ 



**EXAMPLE 1.** A fair coin is tossed twice. Let _X_ be the number of heads that are observed.

1. Construct the probability distribution of _X_.
2. Find the probability that at least one head is observed.

**\[ Solution \]**
