# 4-3. The Binomial Distribution

_Suppose a random experiment has the following characteristics._

1. _There are_ _**n**_ ****_**identical and independent trials** of a common procedure._
2. _There are **exactly two possible outcomes for each trial,** one termed “**success**” and the other “**failure.**”_
3. _The **probability of success** on any one trial is the same number_ _**p**_.

_Then the discrete random variable_ _X_ _that counts the number of successes in the_ _n_ _trials is the_ **binomial random variable with parameters** _n_ **and** _p. We also say that_ _X_ **has a binomial distribution** **with parameters** _n_ **and** _p_.



The following **four examples** illustrate the definition. Note how in every case “success” is the outcome that is counted, not the outcome that we prefer or think is better in some sense.

1. A random sample of 125 students is selected from a large college in which the proportion of students who are females is 57%. Suppose _X_ denotes the number of female students in the sample. In this situation there are _n_ = 125 identical and independent trials of a common procedure, selecting a student at random; there are exactly two possible outcomes for each trial, “success” \(what we are counting, that the student be female\) and “failure;” and finally the probability of success on any one trial is the same number _p_ = 0.57. _X_ is a binomial random variable with parameters _n_ = 125 and _p_ = 0.57.
2. A multiple-choice test has 15 questions, each of which has five choices. An unprepared student taking the test answers each of the questions completely randomly by choosing an arbitrary answer from the five provided. Suppose _X_ denotes the number of answers that the student gets right. _X_ is a binomial random variable with parameters _n_ = 15 and p=1∕5=0.20.p=1∕5=0.20.
3. In a survey of 1,000 registered voters each voter is asked if he intends to vote for a candidate Titania Queen in the upcoming election. Suppose _X_ denotes the number of voters in the survey who intend to vote for Titania Queen. _X_ is a binomial random variable with _n_ = 1000 and _p_ equal to the true proportion of voters \(surveyed or not\) who intend to vote for Titania Queen.
4. An experimental medication was given to 30 patients with a certain medical condition. Suppose _X_ denotes the number of patients who develop severe side effects. _X_ is a binomial random variable with _n_ = 30 and _p_ equal to the true probability that a patient with the underlying condition will experience severe side effects if given that medication.



## 1. Probability Formula for a Binomial Random Variable

If _X_ is a binomial random variable with parameters _n_ and _p_,  then

                                      $$P(x=n) = \frac {n!} {x! (n−x)!} p^x q^{(n−x)}$$ 

where $$q=(1−p)$$ and where for any counting number _m_,  $$m!$$ \(read “_m_ factorial”\) is defined by $$0!=1, 1!=1, 2!=1⋅2, 3!=1⋅2⋅3$$ 

and in general          $$m!=1⋅2 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ (m−1)⋅m$$   


**EXAMPLE 7**. Seventeen percent of victims of financial fraud know the perpetrator of the fraud personally.

1. Use the formula to construct the probability distribution for the number _X_ of people in a random sample of five victims of financial fraud who knew the perpetrator personally.
2. A investigator examines five cases of financial fraud every day. Find the most frequent number of cases each day in which the victim knew the perpetrator.
3. A investigator examines five cases of financial fraud every day. Find the average number of cases per day in which the victim knew the perpetrator.

## **2.** Special Formulas for the Mean and Standard Deviation of a Binomial Random Variable

If _X_ is a binomial random variable with parameters _n_ and _p_, then

                        $$μ=np$$ ,  $$σ^2=npq$$,    $$σ= \sqrt {npq}$$    


**EXAMPLE 8.** Find the mean and standard deviation of the random variable _X_ of  "**Example 7**".



## 3. The Cumulative Probability Distribution of a Binomial Random Variable

In the place of the probability $$P(x)$$ the table contains the probability        

                         $$P(X≤x)=P(0)+P(1)+ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ +P(x)$$ 

This is illustrated in the followinng Figure "**Cumulative Probabilities**". 

![Cumulative Probabilities](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2886%29.png)



If _X_ is a discrete random variable, then

                      $$P(X≥x)=1−P(X≤x−1)$$   

          and  $$P(x)=P(X≤x)−P(X≤x−1)$$   


**EXAMPLE 9.** A student takes a ten-question true/false exam.

1. Find the probability that the student gets exactly six of the questions right simply by guessing the answer on every question.
2. Find the probability that the student will obtain a passing grade of 60% or greater simply by guessing.

**\[ Solution \]**

**EXAMPLE 10.**  An appliance repairman services five washing machines on site each day. One-third of the service calls require installation of a particular part.

1. The repairman has only one such part on his truck today. Find the probability that the one part will be enough today, that is, that at most one washing machine he services will require installation of this particular part.
2. Find the minimum number of such parts he should take with him each day in order that the probability that he have enough for the day's service calls is at least 95%.
