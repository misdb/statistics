# 4-4. Hypergeometric Distribution

[R 초기하분포 \(Hypergeometric distribution\) : dhyper\(x, m, n, k\)](https://rfriend.tistory.com/100)  
  
**Hypergeometric distribution**, in [statistics](https://www.britannica.com/science/statistics), [distribution function](https://www.britannica.com/science/distribution-function) in which selections are made from two groups without replacing members of the groups. The hypergeometric distribution differs from the [binomial distribution](https://www.britannica.com/science/binomial-distribution) in the lack of replacements. Thus, it often is employed in random [sampling](https://www.britannica.com/science/sampling-statistics) for [statistical quality control](https://www.britannica.com/science/statistics/Residual-analysis#ref60723). A simple everyday example would be the random selection of members for a team from a [population](https://www.britannica.com/science/population-biology-and-anthropology) of girls and boys.

In symbols, let the size of the population selected from be _N_, with _k_ elements of the population belonging to one group \(for convenience, called successes\) and _N_ − _k_ belonging to the other group \(called failures\). Further, let the number of samples drawn from the population be _n_, such that 0 ≤ _n_ ≤ _N_. Then the probability \(_P_\) that the number \(_X_\) of elements drawn from the successful group is equal to some number \(_x_\) is given by

using the notation of [binomial coefficients](https://www.britannica.com/science/combinatorics/Problems-of-enumeration#ref21879), or, using [factorial](https://www.britannica.com/science/factorial) notation,

The [mean](https://www.britannica.com/science/mean) of the hypergeometric distribution is  $$\mu = \frac{nk}{N}$$ , 

and the [variance](https://www.britannica.com/topic/variance) \(square of the [standard deviation](https://www.britannica.com/topic/standard-deviation)\) is $$\sigma = \frac{nk(N − k)(N − n)}{N^2(N − 1)}$$ .

**EXAMPLE 1.** A batch of 100 piston rings is known to contain 10 defective rings. If two piston rings are drawn from the batch, write down the probabilities that: 

1. the first ring is defective; 
2. the second ring is defective given that the first one is defective.

**\[ Solution \]**

1. 10/ 100 = 1/10
2. 9/99 = 1/11

**EXMPLE 2.** A batch of 10 rocker cover gaskets contains 4 defective gaskets. If we draw samples of size 3 without replacement, from the batch of 10, find the probability that a sample contains 2 defective gaskets.

**\[ Solution \]**

* $$P(X=r) = \frac { _mC_r \space * \space  _{(n-m)}C_{(n-r)} } {_NC_m}$$ , $$N =10,  n =3, M=4 \space and \space r=2$$ 
* * $$P(X=2) = \frac {_4C_2 * _6C_1} {_{10}C_3} =  \frac {6*6}{120} = 0.3$$ 

**EXAMPLE 3.** For the previous Example, concerning rocker cover gaskets, find the expectation and variance of samples containing 2 defective gaskets.

**\[ Solution \]**

```text
E(X) = np = 3 * 4/10 = 1.2
V(X) = np(1-p) (N-M) / (N-1) = 3 * 4/10 * 6/10 * (10-4)/(10-1)
     = 0.48
```

**EXAMPLE 4.** In the manufacture of car tyres, a particular production process is know to yield 10 tyres with defective walls in every batch of 100 tyres produced. From a production batch of 100 tyres, a sample of 4 is selected for testing to destruction. Find: 

1. the probability that the sample contains 1 defective tyre 
2. the expectation of the number of defectives in samples of size 4 
3. the variance of the number of defectives in samples of size 4.

**\[ Solution \]**

* $$P(X=r) = \frac { _mC_r \space * \space  _{(n-m)}C_{(n-r)} } {_NC_m}$$ , ****$$N =100,  n =4,  M=10, \space and \space p=0.1$$ 

1. $$P(X=1) = \frac { _{10}C_1 * _{(100-10)}C_{(4-1)} } {_{100}C_4} = \frac {10 * 117480 }{3921225} ≈ 0.3$$ 
2. $$E(X) = np = 4 * 0.1 = 0.4$$ 
3. $$V(X) = np(1-p)\frac {N-M}{N-1} = 0.4 * 0.9 * \frac {90}{99} ≈0.33$$
