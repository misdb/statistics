# 4-1. Random Variables

> _A_ **random variable** _is a numerical quantity that is generated by a random experiment._

We will denote random variables by capital letters, such as $$X$$ or $$Z$$ , and the actual values that they can take by lowercase letters, such as $$x$$ and $$z$$ .

| Experiment | Number $$X$$  | Possible Values of $$X$$  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Roll two fair dice | Sum of the number of dots on the top faces | 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 |
| Flip a fair coin repeatedly | Number of tosses until the coin lands heads | 1, 2, 3,4, … |
| Measure the voltage at an electrical outlet | Voltage measured | $$118 ≤ x ≤ 122$$  |
| Operate a light bulb until it burns out | Time until the bulb burns out | $$0 ≤ x < ∞$$  |



> _A random variable is called_ **discrete** _if it has either a finite or a countable number of possible values._ 
>
> _A random variable is called_ **continuous** _if its possible values contain a whole interval of numbers._
