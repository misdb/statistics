# 3-3. Conditional Probability and Independent Events

## 1. Conditional Probability

> _The_ conditional probability **of** _A_ **given** _B_, _denoted_ P\(A\|B\)P\(A\|B\), _is the probability that event_ _A_ _has occurred in a trial of a random experiment for which it is known that event_ _B_ _has definitely occurred. It may be computed by means of the following formula:_

**EXAMPLE 20.** A fair die is rolled.

1. Find the probability that the number rolled is a five, given that it is odd.
2. Find the probability that the number rolled is odd, given that it is a five.

**EXAMPLE 21.** In a sample of 902 individuals under 40 who were or had previously been married, each person was classified according to gender and age at first marriage. The results are summarized in the following two-way classification table, where the meaning of the labels is:

* _M_: male
* _F_: female
* _E_: a teenager when first married
* _W_: in one’s twenties when first married
* _H_: in one’s thirties when first married

|  | _E_ | _W_ | _H_ | Total |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| _M_ | 43 | 293 | 114 | 450 |
| _F_ | 82 | 299 | 71 | 452 |
| Total | 125 | 592 | 185 | 902 |

The numbers in the first row mean that 43 people in the sample were men who were first married in their teens, 293 were men who were first married in their twenties, 114 men who were first married in their thirties, and a total of 450 people in the sample were men. Similarly for the numbers in the second row. The numbers in the last row mean that, irrespective of gender, 125 people in the sample were married in their teens, 592 in their twenties, 185 in their thirties, and that there were 902 people in the sample in all. Suppose that the proportions in the sample accurately reflect those in the population of all individuals in the population who are under 40 and who are or have previously been married. Suppose such a person is selected at random.

1. Find the probability that the individual selected was a teenager at first marriage.
2. Find the probability that the individual selected was a teenager at first marriage, given that the person is male.

**EXAMPLE 22.** Suppose that in an adult population the proportion of people who are both overweight and suffer hypertension is 0.09; the proportion of people who are not overweight but suffer hypertension is 0.11; the proportion of people who are overweight but do not suffer hypertension is 0.02; and the proportion of people who are neither overweight nor suffer hypertension is 0.78. An adult is randomly selected from this population.

1. Find the probability that the person selected suffers hypertension given that he is overweight.
2. Find the probability that the selected person suffers hypertension given that he is not overweight.
3. Compare the two probabilities just found to give an answer to the question as to whether overweight people tend to suffer from hypertension.

## 2. Independent Events

> _Events_ _A_ _and_ _B_ _are_ **independent** _if_              
>
>                                                     $$P(A∩B)=P(A)⋅P(B)$$   __
>
> _If_ _A_ _and_ _B_ _are not independent then they are_ **dependent**.

**EXAMPLE 23.** A single fair die is rolled. Let A={3}A={3} and B={1,3,5}.B={1,3,5}. Are _A_ and _B_ independent?

**EXAMPLE 24.** The two-way classification of married or previously married adults under 40 according to gender and age at first marriage in "Example 21" produced the table

|  | _E_ | _W_ | _H_ | Total |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| _M_ | 43 | 293 | 114 | 450 |
| _F_ | 82 | 299 | 71 | 452 |
| Total | 125 | 592 | 185 | 902 |

Determine whether or not the events _F_: “female” and _E_: “was a teenager at first marriage” are independent.

**EXAMPLE 25.** Many diagnostic tests for detecting diseases do not test for the disease directly but for a chemical or biological product of the disease, hence are not perfectly reliable. The _sensitivity_ of a test is the probability that the test will be positive when administered to a person who has the disease. The higher the sensitivity, the greater the detection rate and the lower the false negative rate.

Suppose the sensitivity of a diagnostic procedure to test whether a person has a particular disease is 92%. A person who actually has the disease is tested for it using this procedure by two independent laboratories.

1. What is the probability that both test results will be positive?
2. What is the probability that at least one of the two test results will be positive?

**\[ Solution \]**



**EXAMPLE 26**. The _specificity_ of a diagnostic test for a disease is the probability that the test will be negative when administered to a person who does not have the disease. The higher the specificity, the lower the false positive rate.

Suppose the specificity of a diagnostic procedure to test whether a person has a particular disease is 89%.

1. A person who does not have the disease is tested for it using this procedure. What is the probability that the test result will be positive?
2. A person who does not have the disease is tested for it by two independent laboratories using this procedure. What is the probability that both test results will be positive?

**\[ Solution \]**



**EXAMPLE 27.** The reliability of a system can be enhanced by redundancy, which means building two or more independent devices to do the same job, such as two independent braking systems in an automobile.

Suppose a particular species of trained dogs has a 90% chance of detecting contraband in airline luggage. If the luggage is checked three times by three different dogs independently of one another, what is the probability that contraband will be detected?

**\[ Solution \]**



## 3. Probabilities on Tree Diagrams

**EXAMPLE 28.** A jar contains 10 marbles, 7 black and 3 white. Two marbles are drawn without replacement, which means that the first one is not put back before the second one is drawn.

1. What is the probability that both marbles are black?
2. What is the probability that exactly one marble is black?
3. What is the probability that at least one marble is black?

**\[ Solution \]**

> **Probabilities on Tree Diagrams**   
>
> 1. The probability of the event corresponding to any node on a tree is the product of the numbers on the unique path of branches that leads to that node from the start.  
> 2. If an event corresponds to several final nodes, then its probability is obtained by adding the numbers next to those nodes.
