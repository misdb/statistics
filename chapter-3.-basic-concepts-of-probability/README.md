### 1\) Sample Spaces and Events

* _A_ **random experiment** _is a mechanism that produces a definite outcome that cannot be predicted with certainty. The_ **sample space** _associated with a random experiment is the set of all possible outcomes. An_ **event** _is a subset of the sample space._
* _An event_ _E_ _is said to_ **occur** _on a particular trial of the experiment if the outcome observed is an element of the set_ _E_.
