# 3-2. Complements, Intersections,and Unions

### Complements

*  _The_ **complement of an event** $$A$$ _in a sample space_ $$S$$ , _denoted_ $$A^c$$ , _is the collection of all outcomes in_ $$S$$_that are not elements of the set_ _A_. _It corresponds to negating any description in words of the event_ $$A$$.

**EXAMPLE 10 :** Two events connected with the experiment of rolling a single die are _E_ : “the number rolled is even” and _T_ : “the number rolled is greater than two.” Find the complement of each.

**\[ Solution \]**

$$S = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$$ 

$$E = \{2,4,6\}$$ , $$T = \{3,4,5,6\}$$ 

$$=> E^C = \{1,3,5\}$$ , and $$T^c = \{1,2\}$$ 



### Probability Rule for Complements

                                                            $$P(A^c)=1−P(A)$$   


**EXAMPLE 11** . Find the probability that at least one heads will appear in five tosses of a fair coin.
