# 3-2. Complements, Intersections,and Unions

## 1. Complements

> _The_ **complement of an event** $$A$$ _in a sample space_ $$S$$ , _denoted_ $$A^c$$ , _is the collection of all outcomes in_ $$S$$_that are not elements of the set_ _A_. _It corresponds to negating any description in words of the event_ $$A$$.



**EXAMPLE 10 :** Two events connected with the experiment of rolling a single die are _E_ : “the number rolled is even” and _T_ : “the number rolled is greater than two.” Find the complement of each.

**\[ Solution \]**

$$S = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$$ 

$$E = \{2,4,6\}$$ , $$T = \{3,4,5,6\}$$ 

$$=> E^C = \{1,3,5\}$$ , and $$T^c = \{1,2\}$$ 



> Probability Rule for Complements      
>                                                             $$P(A^c)=1−P(A)$$

**EXAMPLE 11** . Find the probability that at least one heads will appear in five tosses of a fair coin.

**\[ Solution \]**

* 32 Outcomes for five tosses of coin : $$2^5 = 32$$ 
* $$O^c=\{ttttt\} $$ 
* $$P(O) = 1- P(O^c) = 1 - 1/32 = 31/32 $$ 

## 2. Intersection of Events

> _The_ **intersection of events** _A_ _and_ _B_, _denoted_ _A_ ∩ _B_, _is the collection of all outcomes that are elements of both of the sets_ _A_ _and_ _B_. _It corresponds to combining descriptions of the two events using the word “and.”_ \( A ∩ B \)

**EXAMPLE 12.** In the experiment of rolling a single die, find the intersection E∩T of the events _E_ : “the number rolled is even” and _T_ : “the number rolled is greater than two.”

**\[ Solution \]**

$$S = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$$ 

$$E = \{2,4,6\}$$ , $$T = \{3,4,5,6\}$$ $$=> E ∩ T  = \{4, 6\}$$ 

**EXAMPLE 13.** A single die is rolled.

1. Suppose _the die is fair_. Find the probability that the number rolled is both even and greater than two.
2. Suppose the die has been “loaded” so that P\(1\)=1∕12, P\(6\)=3∕12, and the remaining four outcomes are equally likely with one another. Now find the probability that the number rolled is **both even and greater than two**.

**\[ Solution \]**

$$S=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}, A =  \{2,4,6\}  , B=\{3,4,5,6\},  A ∩ B =\{4, 6\}$$ 

1. $$P(A ∩ B) =P\{4, 6\} = P(4) + P(6) = 2/6 = 1/3$$ 
2. $$P(A ∩ B) =P\{4, 6\} = P(4) + P(6) $$  $$P(4) = ( 1 - 1/12 - 3/12) /4 = 2/12 = 1/6$$     $$=> P(4,6) = 1/6 + 3/12 = 5/12$$ 

### \* Probability Rule for Mutually Exclusive Events

> _Events_ _A_ _and_ _B_ _are_ **mutually exclusive** _if they have no elements in common._

> Events _A_ and _B_ are **mutually exclusive** if and only if
>
>                                                         $$P(A∩B)=0$$

**EXAMPLE 14.** In the experiment of rolling a single die, find three choices for an event _A_ so that the events _A_ and _E_: “the number rolled is even” are mutually exclusive.

**\[ Solution \]**

## 3. Union of Events

> _The_ **union of events** _A_ _and_ _B_, _denoted_ _A_ ∪ _B_, _is the collection of all outcomes that are elements of one or the other of the sets_ _A_ _and_ _B_, _or of both of them. It corresponds to combining descriptions of the two events using the word “or.”_

![The Union of Events A and B : A &#x222A; B](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/section_07/2b9ac417d3f9501644f5bcc1cfdd8ebb.jpg)

**EXAMPLE 15.** In the experiment of rolling a single die, find the union of the events _E_: “the number rolled is even” and _T_: “the number rolled is greater than two.”

**\[ Solution \]**



**EXAMPLE 16.** A two-child family is selected at random. Let _B_ denote the event that at least one child is a boy, let _D_ denote the event that the genders of the two children differ, and let _M_ denote the event that the genders of the two children match. Find _B_ ∪ _D_ and B∪M.B∪M.

>                           $$P(A∪B)=P(A)+P(B)−P(A∩B)$$ ****

**EXAMPLE 17.**  Two fair dice are thrown. Find the probabilities of the following events:

1. both dice show a four
2. at least one die shows a four

**\[ Solution \]**



**EXAMPLE 18.** A tutoring service specializes in preparing adults for high school equivalence tests. Among all the students seeking help from the service, 63% need help in mathematics, 34% need help in English, and 27% need help in both mathematics and English. What is the percentage of students who need help in either mathematics or English?

**EXAMPLE 19.** Volunteers for a disaster relief effort were classified according to both specialty \(_C_: construction, _E_: education, _M_: medicine\) and language ability \(_S_: speaks a single language fluently, _T_: speaks two or more languages fluently\). The results are shown in the following _two-way classification_ _table_:

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2823%29.png)

The first row of numbers means that 12 volunteers whose specialty is construction speak a single language fluently, and 1 volunteer whose specialty is construction speaks at least two languages fluently. Similarly for the other two rows.

A volunteer is selected at random, meaning that each one has an equal chance of being chosen. Find the probability that:

1. his specialty is medicine and he speaks two or more languages;
2. either his specialty is medicine or he speaks two or more languages;
3. his specialty is something other than medicine.
