4. In order to cut costs a wine producer is considering using duo or 1 + 1 corks in place of full natural wood corks, but is concerned that it could affect buyers’s perception of the quality of the wine. The wine producer shipped eight pairs of bottles of its best young wines to eight wine experts. Each pair includes one bottle with a natural wood cork and one with a duo cork. The experts are asked to rate the wines on a one to ten scale, higher numbers corresponding to higher quality. The results are:

## **3. LARGE DATA SET EXERCISES**

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/data5.xls" caption="Data Set 5" %}

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/data12 \(2\).xls" caption="Data Set 12" %}

1. Large Data Set 5 lists the scores for 25 randomly selected students on practice SAT reading tests before and after taking a two-week SAT preparation course. Denote the population of all students who have taken the course as Population 1 and the population of all students who have not taken the course as Population 2.
   1. Compute the 25 differences in the order  after− before after− before, their mean $$\bar{d}$$ , and their sample standard deviation $$s_d$$ .
   2. Give a point estimate for $$μ_d = μ_1−μ_2$$ , the difference in the mean score of all students who have taken the course and the mean score of all who have not.
   3. Construct a 98% confidence interval for $$μ_d.$$ 
   4. Test, at the 1% level of significance, the hypothesis that the mean SAT score increases by at least ten points by taking the two-week preparation course.
2. Large Data Set 12 lists the scores on one round for 75 randomly selected members at a golf course, first using their own original clubs, then two months later after using new clubs with an experimental design. Denote the population of all golfers using their own original clubs as Population 1 and the population of all golfers using the new style clubs as Population 2.
   1. Compute the 75 differences in the order  original clubs− new clubs original clubs− new clubs, their mean $$\bar{d}$$ , and their sample standard deviation $$s_d$$ .
   2. Give a point estimate for $$μ_d = μ_1−μ_2$$, the difference in the mean score of all golfers using their original clubs and the mean score of all golfers using the new kind of clubs.
   3. Construct a 90% confidence interval for $$μ_d.$$ 
   4. Test, at the 1% level of significance, the hypothesis that the mean golf score decreases by at least one stroke by using the new kind of clubs.
3. Consider the previous problem again. Since the data set is so large, it is reasonable to use the standard normal distribution instead of Student’s _t_-distribution with 74 degrees of freedom.
   1. Construct a 90% confidence interval for μdμd using the standard normal distribution, meaning that the formula is $$\bar{d} ±z_{α∕2} \frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}}$$ \(The computations done in part \(a\) of the previous problem still apply and need not be redone.\) How does the result obtained here compare to the result obtained in part \(c\) of the previous problem?
   2. Test, at the 1% level of significance, the hypothesis that the mean golf score decreases by at least one stroke by using the new kind of clubs, using the standard normal distribution. \(All the work done in part \(d\) of the previous problem applies, except the critical value is now zαzα instead of tαtα \(or the _p_-value can be computed exactly instead of only approximated, if you used the _p_-value approach\).\) How does the result obtained here compare to the result obtained in part \(c\) of the previous problem?
   3. Construct the 99% confidence intervals for $$μ_d$$ using both the $$t-$$ and $$z-$$ distributions. How much difference is there in the results now?
