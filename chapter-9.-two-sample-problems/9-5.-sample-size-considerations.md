# 9-5. Sample Size Considerations

As was pointed out at the beginning of [Section 7.4 "Sample Size Considerations"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/fwk-shafer-ch07_s04#fwk-shafer-ch07_s04) in [Chapter 7 "Estimation"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s11-estimation.html), sampling is typically done with definite objectives in mind. For example, a physician might wish to estimate the difference in the average amount of sleep gotten by patients suffering a certain condition with the average amount of sleep got by healthy adults, at 90% confidence and to within half an hour. 

Since **sampling costs time, effort, and money**, it would be useful to be able to **estimate the smallest size** samples that are likely to meet these criteria.

## 1. Estimating $$μ_1−μ_2$$ with Independent Samples

Assuming that large samples will be required, the confidence interval formula for estimating the difference $$ μ_1−μ_2$$ between two population means using independent samples is 

                                                                 $$(\bar{x_1}− \bar{x_2})±E, $$ 

                                                  where   $$E=z_{α∕2} \sqrt{ \frac{s_1^2} {n_1} + \frac{s_2^2} {n_2}} $$ 

To say that we wish to estimate the mean to within a certain number of units means that we want the margin of error $$E$$ to be no larger than that number. The number $$z_{α∕2}$$ is determined by the desired level of confidence.

The numbers _s_1 and _s_2 are estimates of the standard deviations σ1σ1 and σ2σ2 of the two populations. In analogy with what we did in [Section 7.4 "Sample Size Considerations"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/fwk-shafer-ch07_s04#fwk-shafer-ch07_s04) in [Chapter 7 "Estimation"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s11-estimation.html) we will assume that we either know or can reasonably approximate σ1σ1 and σ2.σ2.

We cannot solve for both _n_1 and _n_2, so we have to make an assumption about their relative sizes. We will specify that they be equal. With these assumptions we obtain the minimum sample sizes needed by solving the equation displayed just above for n1=n2.n1=n2.

#### Minimum Equal Sample Sizes for Estimating the Difference in the Means of Two Populations Using Independent Samples

The estimated minimum equal sample sizes n1=n2n1=n2 needed to estimate the difference μ1−μ2μ1−μ2 in two population means to within _E_ units at 100\(1−α\)100\(1−α\)% confidence isn1=n2=\(zα∕2\)2\(σ21+σ22\)E2\(rounded up\)n1=n2=\(zα∕2\)2\(σ12+σ22\)E2\(rounded up\)

In all the examples and exercises the population standard deviations σ1σ1 and σ2σ2 will be given.

#### EXAMPLE 13

A law firm wishes to estimate the difference in the mean delivery time of documents sent between two of its offices by two different courier companies, to within half an hour and with 99.5% confidence. From their records it will randomly sample the same number _n_ of documents as delivered by each courier company. Determine how large _n_ must be if the estimated standard deviations of the delivery times are 0.75 hour for one company and 1.15 hours for the other.

Solution:







## 2. Estimating $$μ_1−μ_2$$ with Paired Samples

As we mentioned at the end of [Section 9.3 "Comparison of Two Population Means: Paired Samples"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/fwk-shafer-ch09_s03#fwk-shafer-ch09_s03), if the sample is large \(meaning that _n_ ≥ 30\) then in the formula for the confidence interval we may replace tα∕2tα∕2 by zα∕2zα∕2, so that the confidence interval formula becomes d−−±Ed-±E forE=zα∕2sdn−−√E=zα∕2sdn

The number _sd_ is an estimate of the standard deviations σdσd of the population of differences. We must assume that we either know or can reasonably approximate σd.σd. Thus, assuming that large samples will be required to meet the criteria given, we can solve the displayed equation for _n_ to obtain an estimate of the number of pairs needed in the sample.

#### Minimum Sample Size for Estimating the Difference in the Means of Two Populations Using Paired Difference Samples

The estimated minimum number of pairs _n_ needed to estimate the difference μd=μ1−μ2μd=μ1−μ2 in two population means to within _E_ units at 100\(1−α\)100\(1−α\)% confidence using paired difference samples isn=\(zα∕2\)2σ2dE2\(rounded up\)n=\(zα∕2\)2σd2E2\(rounded up\)

In all the examples and exercises the population standard deviation of the differences σdσd will be given.

#### EXAMPLE 14

A automotive tire manufacturer wishes to compare the mean lifetime of two tread designs under actual driving conditions. They will mount one of each type of tire on _n_ vehicles \(both on the front or both on the back\) and measure the difference in remaining tread after 20,000 miles of driving. If the standard deviation of the differences is assumed to be 0.025 inch, find the minimum samples size needed to estimate the difference in mean depth \(at 20,000 miles use\) to within 0.01 inch at 99.9% confidence.

Solution:



## 3. Estimating $$p_1−p_2$$ 

The confidence interval formula for estimating the difference p1−p2p1−p2 between two population proportions is pˆ1−pˆ2±Ep^1−p^2±E, whereE=zα∕2pˆ1\(1−pˆ1\)n1+pˆ2\(1−pˆ2\)n2−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−√E=zα∕2p^1\(1−p^1\)n1+p^2\(1−p^2\)n2

To say that we wish to estimate the mean to within a certain number of units means that we want the margin of error _E_ to be no larger than that number. The number zα∕2zα∕2 is determined by the desired level of confidence.

We cannot solve for both _n_1 and _n_2, so we have to make an assumption about their relative sizes. We will specify that they be equal. With these assumptions we obtain the minimum sample sizes needed by solving the displayed equation for n1=n2.n1=n2.

#### Minimum Equal Sample Sizes for Estimating the Difference in Two Population Proportions

The estimated minimum equal sample sizes n1=n2n1=n2 needed to estimate the difference p1−p2p1−p2 in two population proportions to within _E_ percentage points at 100\(1−α\)100\(1−α\)% confidence isn1=n2=\(zα∕2\)2\(pˆ1\(1−pˆ1\)+pˆ2\(1−pˆ2\)\)E2\(rounded up\)n1=n2=\(zα∕2\)2\(p^1\(1−p^1\)+p^2\(1−p^2\)\)E2\(rounded up\)

Here we face the same dilemma that we encountered in the case of a single population proportion: the formula for estimating how large a sample to take contains the numbers pˆ1p^1 and pˆ2p^2, which we know only after we have taken the sample. There are two ways out of this dilemma. Typically the researcher will have some idea as to the values of the population proportions _p_1 and _p_2, hence of what the sample proportions pˆ1p^1 and pˆ2p^2 are likely to be. If so, those estimates can be used in the formula.

The second approach to resolving the dilemma is simply to replace each of pˆ1p^1 and pˆ2p^2 in the formula by 0.5. As in the one-population case, this is the **most conservative estimate**, since it gives the largest possible estimate of _n_. If we have an estimate of only one of _p_1 and _p_2 we can use that estimate for it, and use the conservative estimate 0.5 for the other.

#### EXAMPLE 15

Find the minimum equal sample sizes necessary to construct a 98% confidence interval for the difference p1−p2p1−p2 with a margin of error _E_ = 0.05,

1. assuming that no prior knowledge about _p_1 or _p_2 is available; and
2. assuming that prior studies suggest that p1≈0.2p1≈0.2 and p2≈0.3.p2≈0.3.

Solution:
