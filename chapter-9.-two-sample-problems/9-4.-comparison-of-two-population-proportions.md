# 9-4. Comparison of Two Population Proportions

Suppose we wish to compare the proportions of two populations that have a specific characteristic, such as the proportion of men who are left-handed compared to the proportion of women who are left-handed. [Figure 9.7 "Independent Sampling from Two Populations In Order to Compare Proportions"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s13-two-sample-problems.html#fwk-shafer-ch09_s04_f01) illustrates the conceptual framework of our investigation. Each population is divided into two groups, the group of elements that have the characteristic of interest \(for example, being left-handed\) and the group of elements that do not. We arbitrarily label one population as Population 1 and the other as Population 2, and subscript the proportion of each population that possesses the characteristic with the number 1 or 2 to tell them apart. We draw a random sample from Population 1 and label the sample statistic it yields with the subscript 1. Without reference to the first sample we draw a sample from Population 2 and label its sample statistic with the subscript 2.

Our goal is to use the information in the _samples_ to estimate the difference p1−p2p1−p2 in the two _population_ proportions and to make statistically valid inferences about it.

### Confidence Intervals

Since the sample proportion pˆ1p^1 computed using the sample drawn from Population 1 is a good estimator of population proportion _p_1 of Population 1 and the sample proportion pˆ2p^2 computed using the sample drawn from Population 2 is a good estimator of population proportion _p_2 of Population 2, a reasonable point estimate of the difference p1−p2p1−p2 is pˆ1−pˆ2.p^1−p^2. In order to widen this point estimate into a confidence interval we suppose that both samples are large, as described in [Section 7.3 "Large Sample Estimation of a Population Proportion"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/fwk-shafer-ch07_s03#fwk-shafer-ch07_s03) in [Chapter 7 "Estimation"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s11-estimation.html) and repeated below. If so, then the following formula for a confidence interval for p1−p2p1−p2 is valid.

#### 100\(1−α\)%100\(1−α\)% Confidence Interval for the Difference Between Two Population Proportions

\(pˆ1−pˆ2\)±zα∕2pˆ1\(1−pˆ1\)n1+pˆ2\(1−pˆ2\)n2−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−√\(p^1−p^2\)±zα∕2p^1\(1−p^1\)n1+p^2\(1−p^2\)n2

The samples must be independent, and _each_ sample must be large: each of the intervals\[pˆ1−3 pˆ1\(1−pˆ1\)n1−−−−−−−−−√, pˆ1+3 pˆ1\(1−pˆ1\)n1−−−−−−−−−√ \]\[p^1−3 p^1\(1−p^1\)n1, p^1+3 p^1\(1−p^1\)n1 \]

and\[pˆ2−3 pˆ2\(1−pˆ2\)n2−−−−−−−−−√, pˆ2+3 pˆ2\(1−pˆ2\)n2−−−−−−−−−√ \]\[p^2−3 p^2\(1−p^2\)n2, p^2+3 p^2\(1−p^2\)n2 \]

must lie wholly within the interval \[0,1 \].\[0,1 \].

#### EXAMPLE 10

The department of code enforcement of a county government issues permits to general contractors to work on residential projects. For each permit issued, the department inspects the result of the project and gives a “pass” or “fail” rating. A failed project must be re-inspected until it receives a pass rating. The department had been frustrated by the high cost of re-inspection and decided to publish the inspection records of all contractors on the web. It was hoped that public access to the records would lower the re-inspection rate. A year after the web access was made public, two samples of records were randomly selected. One sample was selected from the pool of records before the web publication and one after. The proportion of projects that passed on the first inspection was noted for each sample. The results are summarized below. Construct a point estimate and a 90% confidence interval for the difference in the passing rate on first inspection between the two time periods.No public web accessPublic web accessn1=500n2=100pˆ1=0.67pˆ2=0.80No public web accessn1=500p^1=0.67Public web accessn2=100p^2=0.80

### Hypothesis Testing

In hypothesis tests concerning the relative sizes of the proportions _p_1 and _p_2 of two populations that possess a particular characteristic, the null and alternative hypotheses will always be expressed in terms of the difference of the two population proportions. Hence the null hypothesis is always writtenH0:p1−p2=D0H0:p1−p2=D0

The three forms of the alternative hypothesis, with the terminology for each case, are:

| Form of HaHa | Terminology |
| :--- | :--- |
| Ha:p1−p2&lt;D0Ha:p1−p2&lt;D0 | Left-tailed |
| Ha:p1−p2&gt;D0Ha:p1−p2&gt;D0 | Right-tailed |
| Ha:p1−p2≠D0Ha:p1−p2≠D0 | Two-tailed |

As long as the samples are independent and both are large the following formula for the standardized test statistic is valid, and it has the standard normal distribution.

#### Standardized Test Statistic for Hypothesis Tests Concerning the Difference Between Two Population Proportions

Z=\(pˆ1−pˆ2\)−D0pˆ1\(1−pˆ1\)n1+pˆ2\(1−pˆ2\)n2−−−−−−−−−−−−−−√Z=\(p^1−p^2\)−D0p^1\(1−p^1\)n1+p^2\(1−p^2\)n2

The test statistic has the standard normal distribution.

The samples must be independent, and _each_ sample must be large: each of the intervals\[pˆ1−3 pˆ1\(1−pˆ1\)n1−−−−−−−−−√, pˆ1+3 pˆ1\(1−pˆ1\)n1−−−−−−−−−√ \]\[p^1−3 p^1\(1−p^1\)n1, p^1+3 p^1\(1−p^1\)n1 \]

and\[pˆ2−3 pˆ2\(1−pˆ2\)n2−−−−−−−−−√,   pˆ2+3 pˆ2\(1−pˆ2\)n2−−−−−−−−−√ \]\[p^2−3 p^2\(1−p^2\)n2,   p^2+3 p^2\(1−p^2\)n2 \]

must lie wholly within the interval \[0,1 \].\[0,1 \].

#### EXAMPLE 11

Using the data of [Note 9.25 "Example 10"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s13-two-sample-problems.html#fwk-shafer-ch09_s04_s01_n02), test whether there is sufficient evidence to conclude that public web access to the inspection records has increased the proportion of projects that passed on the first inspection by more than 5 percentage points. Use the critical value approach at the 10% level of significance.

Solution:



#### EXAMPLE 12

Perform the test of [Note 9.27 "Example 11"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s13-two-sample-problems.html#fwk-shafer-ch09_s04_s02_n02) using the _p_-value approach.

Solution:





Finally a common misuse of the formulas given in this section must be mentioned. Suppose a large pre-election survey of potential voters is conducted. Each person surveyed is asked to express a preference between, say, Candidate A and Candidate B. \(Perhaps “no preference” or “other” are also choices, but that is not important.\) In such a survey, estimators pˆAp^A and pˆBp^B of _pA_ and _pB_ can be calculated. It is important to realize, however, that these two estimators were not calculated from two independent samples. While pˆA−pˆBp^A−p^B may be a reasonable estimator of pA−pBpA−pB, the formulas for confidence intervals and for the standardized test statistic given in this section are not valid for data obtained in this manner.
