## **2. APPLICATIONS**

1. A county environmental agency suspects that the fish in a particular polluted lake have elevated mercury level. To confirm that suspicion, five striped bass in that lake were caught and their tissues were tested for mercury. For the purpose of comparison, four striped bass in an unpolluted lake were also caught and tested. The fish tissue mercury levels in mg/kg are given below.Sample 1 \(from polluted lake\)0.5800.7110.5710.6660.598Sample 2\(from unpolluted lake\)0.3820.2760.5700.366Sample 1 Sample 2\(from polluted lake\)\(from unpolluted lake\)0.5800.3820.7110.2760.5710.5700.6660.3660.598
   1. Construct the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the population means based on these data.
   2. Test, at the 5% level of significance, whether the data provide sufficient evidence to conclude that fish in the polluted lake have elevated levels of mercury in their tissue.
2. A genetic engineering company claims that it has developed a genetically modified tomato plant that yields on average more tomatoes than other varieties. A farmer wants to test the claim on a small scale before committing to a full-scale planting. Ten genetically modified tomato plants are grown from seeds along with ten other tomato plants. At the season’s end, the resulting yields in pound are recorded as below.Sample 1\(genetically modified\)20232725252527232422Sample 2\(regular\)21212218202018252320Sample 1Sample 2\(genetically modified\)\(regular\)2021232127222518252025202718232524232220

5. A university administrator wishes to know if there is a difference in average starting salary for graduates with master’s degrees in engineering and those with master’s degrees in business. Fifteen recent graduates with master’s degree in engineering and 11 with master’s degrees in business are surveyed and the results are summarized below.

6. A gardener sets up a flower stand in a busy business district and sells bouquets of assorted fresh flowers on weekdays. To find a more profitable pricing, she sells bouquets for 15 dollars each for ten days, then for 10 dollars each for five days. Her average daily profit for the two different prices are given below.

   |  | _n_ | x−−x- | _s_ |

   1. Construct the 90% confidence interval for the difference in the population means based on these data.
   2. Test, at the 10% level of significance, whether the data provide sufficient evidence to conclude the gardener’s average daily profit will be higher if the bouquets are sold at $10 each.
