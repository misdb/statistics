# 9-1. Comparison of Two Population Means: Large, Independent Samples

The previous two chapters treated the questions of estimating and making inferences about a parameter of a single population. 

In this chapter we consider a comparison of parameters that belong to two different populations. For example, we might wish to compare the average income of all adults in one region of the country with the average income of those in another region, or we might wish to compare the proportion of all men who are vegetarians with the proportion of all women who are vegetarians.

We will study construction of confidence intervals and tests of hypotheses in four situations, depending on the parameter of interest, the sizes of the samples drawn from each of the populations, and the method of sampling. We also examine sample size considerations.

### 9.1 Comparison of Two Population Means: Large, Independent Samples

#### LEARNING OBJECTIVES

1. To understand the logical framework for estimating the difference between the means of two distinct populations and performing tests of hypotheses concerning those means.
2. To learn how to construct a confidence interval for the difference in the means of two distinct populations using large, independent samples.
3. To learn how to perform a test of hypotheses concerning the difference between the means of two distinct populations using large, independent samples.

Suppose we wish to compare the means of two distinct populations. [Figure 9.1 "Independent Sampling from Two Populations"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s13-two-sample-problems.html#fwk-shafer-ch09_s01_f01) illustrates the conceptual framework of our investigation in this and the next section. Each population has a mean and a standard deviation. 

We arbitrarily label one population as Population 1 and the other as Population 2, and subscript the parameters with the numbers 1 and 2 to tell them apart. We draw a random sample from Population 1 and label the sample statistics it yields with the subscript 1. 

Without reference to the first sample we draw a sample from Population 2 and label its sample statistics with the subscript 2.

> _Samples from two distinct populations are_ **independent** _if each one is drawn without reference to the other, and has no connection with the other._



Our goal is to use the information in the _samples_ to estimate the difference $$(μ1−μ2)$$ in the means of the **two** _**populations**_ and to make statistically valid inferences about it.

## 1. Confidence Intervals

Since the mean $$\bar{x_1}$$ of the sample drawn from Population 1 is a good estimator of $$μ_1$$ and the mean $$\bar{x_2}$$ of the sample drawn from Population 2 is a good estimator of $$μ_2$$, a reasonable **point estimate** of the difference $$(μ_1- μ_2)$$ is $$(\bar{x_1}-\bar{x_2})$$ . 

In order to widen this point estimate into a confidence interval, we first suppose that **both samples are large**, that is, that both $$n1≥30$$ and $$n2≥30.$$ If so, then the following formula for a confidence interval for $$(μ_1- μ_2)$$ is valid. 

The symbols $$s_1^2$$ and $$s_2^2$$ denote the squares of $$s_1$$ and $$s_2$$. \(In the relatively rare case that both population **standard deviations** $$σ1$$ **and** $$σ2$$ **ar**~~**e**~~ **known** they would be used instead of the sample standard deviations.\)

**EXAMPLE 1.** To compare customer satisfaction levels of two competing cable television companies, 174 customers of Company 1 and 355 customers of Company 2 were randomly selected and were asked to rate their cable companies on a five-point scale, with 1 being least satisfied and 5 most satisfied. The survey results are summarized in the following table:

| Company 1 | Company 2 |
| :--- | :--- |
| $$n_1=174$$  | $$n_2=355$$  |
| $$\bar{x_1}=3.51$$  | $$\bar{x_2}=3.24$$  |
| $$s_1=0.51$$  | $$s_2=0.52$$  |

Construct a point estimate and a 99% confidence interval for $$(μ_1- μ_2)$$, the difference in average satisfaction levels of customers of the two companies as measured on this five-point scale.

**\[ Solution \]**

1. The **point estimate** of $$(μ_1- μ_2)$$ is $$(\bar{x_1}-\bar{x_2}) =(3.51−3.24)=0.27.$$   In words, we estimate that the average customer satisfaction level for Company 1 is 0.27 points higher on this five-point scale than it is for Company 2. 
2. To apply the formula for the confidence interval, proceed exactly as was done in [Chapter 7 "Estimation"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s11-estimation.html).  The 99% confidence level means that $$ α=(1−0.99)=0.01$$ so that $$z_{α∕2}=z_{0.005}.$$ From [Figure 12.3 "Critical Values of "](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s16-appendix.html) we read directly that $$z_{0.005}=2.576.$$  Thus              $$(\bar{x_1}-\bar{x_2})  ±z_{\frac{α}{2}} \sqrt { \frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}  }$$               $$= 0.27±2.576 \sqrt{\frac{0.51^2} {174}+ \frac{0.52^2}{355}}$$               $$= 0.27±0.12$$ 
3. We are 99% confident that the **difference in the population means** lies in the interval $$[0.15,0.39]$$ , in the sense that in repeated sampling 99% of all intervals constructed from the sample data in this manner will contain $$(μ_1- μ_2)$$.  In the context of the problem we say we are 99% confident that the average level of customer satisfaction for Company 1 is between 0.15 and 0.39 points higher, on this five-point scale, than that for Company 2.

## 2. Hypothesis Testing

Hypotheses concerning the relative sizes of the means of two populations are tested using the same critical value and _p_-value procedures that were used in the case of a single population. All that is needed is to know how to express the null and alternative hypotheses and to know the formula for the standardized test statistic and the distribution that it follows.

The null and alternative hypotheses will always be expressed in terms of the difference of the two population means. Thus the null hypothesis will always be writtenH0:μ1−μ2=D0H0:μ1−μ2=D0

where _D_0 is a number that is deduced from the statement of the situation. As was the case with a single population the alternative hypothesis can take one of the three forms, with the same terminology:

| Form of HaHa | Terminology |
| :--- | :--- |
| Ha:μ1−μ2&lt;D0Ha:μ1−μ2&lt;D0 | Left-tailed |
| Ha:μ1−μ2&gt;D0Ha:μ1−μ2&gt;D0 | Right-tailed |
| Ha:μ1−μ2≠D0Ha:μ1−μ2≠D0 | Two-tailed |

As long as the samples are independent and both are large the following formula for the standardized test statistic is valid, and it has the standard normal distribution. \(In the relatively rare case that both population standard deviations σ1σ1 and σ2σ2 are known they would be used instead of the sample standard deviations.\)

#### Standardized Test Statistic for Hypothesis Tests Concerning the Difference Between Two Population Means: Large, Independent Samples

Z=\(x−−1−x−−2\)−D0s21n1+s22n2−−−−−−−√Z=\(x-1−x-2\)−D0s12n1+s22n2

The test statistic has the standard normal distribution.

The samples must be independent, and _each_ sample must be large: n1≥30n1≥30 and n2≥30.n2≥30.

#### EXAMPLE 2

Refer to [Note 9.4 "Example 1"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s13-two-sample-problems.html#fwk-shafer-ch09_s01_s01_n02) concerning the mean satisfaction levels of customers of two competing cable television companies. Test at the 1% level of significance whether the data provide sufficient evidence to conclude that Company 1 has a higher mean satisfaction rating than does Company 2. Use the critical value approach.

**\[ Solution \]**





#### EXAMPLE 3

Perform the test of [Note 9.6 "Example 2"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s13-two-sample-problems.html#fwk-shafer-ch09_s01_s02_n02) using the _p_-value approach.
