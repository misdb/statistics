Use this information and the symmetry of the density function to find the probability that _X_ takes a value greater than 47. Sketch the density curve with relevant regions shaded to illustrate the computation.
8. A continuous random variable _X_ has a normal distribution with mean 12.25. The probability that _X_ takes a value less than 13 is 0.82.

## **2. APPLICATIONS**

1. Dogberry's alarm clock is battery operated. The battery could fail with equal probability at any time of the day or night. Every day Dogberry sets his alarm for 6:30 a.m. and goes to bed at 10:00 p.m. Find the probability that when the clock battery finally dies, it will do so at the most inconvenient time, between 10:00 p.m. and 6:30 a.m.
2. Buses running a bus line near Desdemona's house run every 15 minutes. Without paying attention to the schedule she walks to the nearest stop to take the bus to town. Find the probability that she waits more than 10 minutes.
3. The amount _X_ of orange juice in a randomly selected half-gallon container varies according to a normal distribution with mean 64 ounces and standard deviation 0.25 ounce.
   1. Sketch the graph of the density function for _X_.
   2. What proportion of all containers contain less than a half gallon \(64 ounces\)? Explain.
   3. What is the median amount of orange juice in such containers? Explain.
4. The weight _X_ of grass seed in bags marked 50 lb varies according to a normal distribution with mean 50 lb and standard deviation 1 ounce \(0.0625 lb\).
   1. Sketch the graph of the density function for _X_.
   2. What proportion of all bags weigh less than 50 pounds? Explain.
   3. What is the median weight of such bags? Explain.
