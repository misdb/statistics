# 5-4. Areas of Tails of Distributions

_The_ **left tail** _of a density curve_  $$y=f(x)$$ _of a continuous random variable_ _X_ _cut off by a value_ $$x^*$$ _of_ _X_ _is the region under the curve that is to the left of_ $$x^*$$ , _as shown by the shading in Figure  "Right and Left Tails of a Distribution" \(a\). The_ **right tail** _cut off by_ $$x^*$$ _is defined similarly, as indicated by the shading in Figure   "Right and Left Tails of a Distribution" \(b\)_.

## 1. Tails of the Standard Normal Distribution

 At times it is important to be able to solve the kind of problem illustrated by the figure as follows. We have a certain specific area in mind, in this case the area 0.0125 of the shaded region in the figure, and we want to find the value $$z^*$$ of _Z_ that produces it. This is exactly the reverse of the kind of problems encountered so far. Instead of knowing a value $$z^*$$ of _Z_ and finding a corresponding area, we know the area and want to find $$z^*.$$ In the case at hand, in the terminology of the definition just above, we wish to find the value $$z^*$$ that cuts off a left tail of area 0.0125 in the standard normal distribution.

**EXAMPLE 12.** Find the value $$z^*$$ of _Z_ as determined by the above figure: the value $$z^*$$ that cuts off a left tail of area 0.0125 in the standard normal distribution. In symbols, find the number $$z^*$$ such that $$P(Z<z^*)=0.0125.$$
