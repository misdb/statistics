# 5-2. The Standard Normal Distribution

## **1.** The Probability Distribution of a Continuous Random Variable

_The_ **probability distribution of a continuous random variable** _X_ _is an assignment of probabilities to **intervals** of decimal numbers using a function_ $$f(x)$$ , _called a_ density function, _in the following way: the probability that_ _X_ _assumes a value in the interval_ \[a,b\]\[a,b\] _is equal to the area of the region that is bounded above by the graph of the equation_ $$y=f(x)$$ , _bounded below by the_ _x-axis, and bounded on the left and right by the vertical lines through_ _a_ _and_ _b_, _as illustrated in Figure  "Probability Given as Area of a Region under a Curve"_.

![Probability Given as Area of a Region under a Curve](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/section_09/a4a078a33c22b212350844a6cd8789b6.jpg)



Every density function $$f(x)$$ must satisfy the following two conditions:

1. For all numbers _x_, $$ f(x)≥0$$ , so that the graph of $$y=f(x)$$ never drops below the _x_-axis.
2. The area of the region under the graph of $$y=f(x)$$ and above the _x_-axis is 1.

For any continuous random variable _X_ :

      $$P(a≤X≤b)=P(a<X≤b)=P(a≤X<b)=P(a<X<b)$$   


### 1-1. Uniform Distribution

**EXAMPLE 1.**  

A random variable _X_  has the **uniform distribution** on the interval $$[0,1]$$ :   
the density function is       
                             $$f(x)=1$$ if _x_ is between 0 and 1   
                      and $$f(x)=0$$ for all other values of _x_,   
as shown in Figure  "Uniform Distribution on ".

1. Find $$P(X > 0.75)$$ , the probability that _X_ assumes a value greater than 0.75.
2. Find $$P(X ≤ 0.2)$$ , the probability that _X_ assumes a value less than or equal to 0.2.
3. Find $$P(0.4 < X < 0.7)$$ , the probability that _X_ assumes a value between 0.4 and 0.7.

**EXAMPLE 2**. A man arrives at a bus stop at a random time \(that is, with no regard for the scheduled service\) to catch the next bus. Buses run every 30 minutes without fail, hence the next bus will come any time during the next 30 minutes with evenly distributed probability \(a uniform distribution\). Find the probability that a bus will come within the next 10 minutes.

**\[ Solution \]**

## 2. Normal Distributions

The formula for $$f(x) $$ contains two parameters _μ_ and _σ_ that can be assigned any specific numerical values, so long as $$σ$$ is positive. We will not need to know the formula for $$f(x)$$ , but for those who are interested it is

                                                               $$f(x)= \frac {1} {\sqrt{2πσ^2}} e^{− 1/2 (μ−x)^2/σ^2 } $$ 

where $$π≈3.14159$$ and $$e ≈ 2.71828$$ is the base of the natural logarithms.

![Bell Curves with &#x3C3; = 0.25 and Different Values of &#x3BC;](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2820%29.png)

 The value of _σ_ determines whether the bell curve is tall and thin or short and squat, subject always to the condition that the total area under the curve be equal to 1.

* _The probability distribution corresponding to the density function for the bell curve with parameters_ _μ_ _and_ _σ_ _is called the_ **normal distribution** _with mean_ _μ_ _and standard deviation_ _σ_.



* _A continuous random variable whose probabilities are described by the normal distribution with mean_ _μ_ _and standard deviation_ _σ_ _is called a_ **normally distributed random variable, or a normal random variable** _for short, with mean_ _μ_ _and standard deviation_ _σ_.



* The density curve for the normal distribution is **symmetric about the mean**.

**EXAMPLE 3.** Heights of 25-year-old men in a certain region have mean 69.75 inches and standard deviation 2.59 inches. These heights are approximately normally distributed. Thus the height _X_ of a randomly selected 25-year-old man is a normal random variable with mean _μ_ = 69.75 and standard deviation _σ_ = 2.59. Sketch a qualitatively accurate graph of the density function for _X_. Find the probability that a randomly selected 25-year-old man is more than 69.75 inches tall.
