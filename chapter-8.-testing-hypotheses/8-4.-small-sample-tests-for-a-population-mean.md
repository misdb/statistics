# 8-4. Small Sample Tests for a Population Mean

In the previous section hypotheses testing for population means was described in the case of large samples. The statistical validity of the tests was insured by the Central Limit Theorem, with essentially no assumptions on the distribution of the population. When sample sizes are small, as is often the case in practice, the Central Limit Theorem does not apply. One must then impose stricter assumptions on the population to give statistical validity to the test procedure. One common assumption is that the population from which the sample is taken has a normal probability distribution to begin with. Under such circumstances, if the population standard deviation is known, then the test statistic \(x−−−μ0\)/\(σ/n−−√\)\(x-−μ0\)∕\(σ∕n\) still has the standard normal distribution, as in the previous two sections. If _σ_ is unknown and is approximated by the sample standard deviation _s_, then the resulting test statistic \(x−−−μ0\)/\(s/n−−√\)\(x-−μ0\)∕\(s∕n\) follows Student’s _t_-distribution with n−1n−1 degrees of freedom.

#### Standardized Test Statistics for Small Sample Hypothesis Tests Concerning a Single Population Mean

 If σ is known: Z=x−−−μ0σ/n√ If σ is unknown: T=x−−−μ0s/n√ If σ is known: Z=x-−μ0σ∕n If σ is unknown: T=x-−μ0s∕n

The first test statistic \(_σ_ known\) has the standard normal distribution.

The second test statistic \(_σ_ unknown\) has Student’s _t_-distribution with n−1n−1 degrees of freedom.

The population must be normally distributed.

The distribution of the second standardized test statistic \(the one containing _s_\) and the corresponding rejection region for each form of the alternative hypothesis \(left-tailed, right-tailed, or two-tailed\), is shown in [Figure 8.11 "Distribution of the Standardized Test Statistic and the Rejection Region"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s12-testing-hypotheses.html#fwk-shafer-ch08_s04_f01). This is just like [Figure 8.4 "Distribution of the Standardized Test Statistic and the Rejection Region"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/fwk-shafer-ch08_s02#fwk-shafer-ch08_s02_f01), except that now the critical values are from the _t_-distribution. [Figure 8.4 "Distribution of the Standardized Test Statistic and the Rejection Region"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/fwk-shafer-ch08_s02#fwk-shafer-ch08_s02_f01) still applies to the first standardized test statistic \(the one containing _σ_\) since it follows the standard normal distribution.

The _p_-value of a test of hypotheses for which the test statistic has Student’s _t_-distribution can be computed using statistical software, but it is impractical to do so using tables, since that would require 30 tables analogous to [Figure 12.2 "Cumulative Normal Probability"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s16-appendix.html), one for each degree of freedom from 1 to 30. [Figure 12.3 "Critical Values of "](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s16-appendix.html) can be used to approximate the _p_-value of such a test, and this is typically adequate for making a decision using the _p_-value approach to hypothesis testing, although not always. For this reason the tests in the two examples in this section will be made following the critical value approach to hypothesis testing summarized at the end of [Section 8.1 "The Elements of Hypothesis Testing"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/fwk-shafer-ch08_s01#fwk-shafer-ch08_s01), but after each one we will show how the _p_-value approach could have been used.

#### EXAMPLE 10

The price of a popular tennis racket at a national chain store is $179. Portia bought five of the same racket at an online auction site for the following prices:

155179175175161155179175175161

Assuming that the auction prices of rackets are normally distributed, determine whether there is sufficient evidence in the sample, at the 5% level of significance, to conclude that the average price of the racket is less than $179 if purchased at an online auction.

Solution:





To perform the test in [Note 8.42 "Example 10"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s12-testing-hypotheses.html#fwk-shafer-ch08_s04_n03) using the _p_-value approach, look in the row in [Figure 12.3 "Critical Values of "](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s16-appendix.html) with the heading df=4df=4 and search for the two _t_-values that bracket the unsigned value 2.152 of the test statistic. They are 2.132 and 2.776, in the columns with headings _t_0.050 and _t_0.025. They cut off right tails of area 0.050 and 0.025, so because 2.152 is between them it must cut off a tail of area between 0.050 and 0.025. By symmetry −2.152 cuts off a left tail of area between 0.050 and 0.025, hence the _p_-value corresponding to t=−2.152t=−2.152 is between 0.025 and 0.05. Although its precise value is unknown, it must be less than α=0.05α=0.05, so the decision is to reject _H_0.

#### EXAMPLE 11

A small component in an electronic device has two small holes where another tiny part is fitted. In the manufacturing process the average distance between the two holes must be tightly controlled at 0.02 mm, else many units would be defective and wasted. Many times throughout the day quality control engineers take a small sample of the components from the production line, measure the distance between the two holes, and make adjustments if needed. Suppose at one time four units are taken and the distances are measured as

0.0210.0190.0230.0200.0210.0190.0230.020

Determine, at the 1% level of significance, if there is sufficient evidence in the sample to conclude that an adjustment is needed. Assume the distances of interest are normally distributed.

Solution:





 To perform the test in [Note 8.43 "Example 11"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s12-testing-hypotheses.html#fwk-shafer-ch08_s04_n04) using the _p_-value approach, look in the row in [Figure 12.3 "Critical Values of "](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s16-appendix.html) with the heading df=3df=3 and search for the two _t_-values that bracket the value 0.877 of the test statistic. Actually 0.877 is smaller than the smallest number in the row, which is 0.978, in the column with heading _t_0.200. The value 0.978 cuts off a right tail of area 0.200, so because 0.877 is to its left it must cut off a tail of area greater than 0.200. Thus the _p_-value, which is the double of the area cut off \(since the test is two-tailed\), is greater than 0.400. Although its precise value is unknown, it must be greater than α=0.01α=0.01, so the decision is not to reject _H_0.
