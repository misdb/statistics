# 8-1. The Elements of Hypothesis Testing

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/ch9\_hyp\_testing.pdf" caption="Testing of Hypothesis" %}

A manufacturer of emergency equipment asserts that a respirator that it makes delivers pure air for 75 minutes on average. A government regulatory agency is charged with testing such claims, in this case to verify that the average time is not less than 75 minutes. To do so it would select a random sample of respirators, compute the mean time that they deliver pure air, and compare that mean to the asserted time 75 minutes.

In the sampling that we have studied so far the goal has been to estimate a population parameter. But the sampling done by the government agency has a somewhat different objective, not so much to _estimate_ the population mean _μ_ as to _test_ an assertion—or a hypothesis—about it, namely, whether it is as large as 75 or not. The agency is not necessarily interested in the actual value of _μ_, just whether it is as claimed. Their sampling is done to perform a test of hypotheses, the subject of this chapter.

### 8.1 The Elements of Hypothesis Testing

#### LEARNING OBJECTIVES

1. To understand the logical framework of tests of hypotheses.
2. To learn basic terminology connected with hypothesis testing.
3. To learn fundamental facts about hypothesis testing.

### Types of Hypotheses

A _hypothesis_ about the value of a population parameter is an assertion about its value. As in the introductory example we will be concerned with testing the truth of two competing hypotheses, only one of which can be true.

#### Definition

_The_ null hypothesis_, denoted_ _H_0_, is the statement about the population parameter that is assumed to be true unless there is convincing evidence to the contrary_.

_The_ alternative hypothesis_, denoted_ _Ha, is a statement about the population parameter that is contradictory to the null hypothesis, and is accepted as true only if there is convincing evidence in favor of it._

#### Definition

Hypothesis testing _is a statistical procedure in which a choice is made between a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis based on information in a sample._

The end result of a hypotheses testing procedure is a choice of one of the following two possible conclusions:

1. Reject _H_0 \(and therefore accept _Ha_\), or
2. Fail to reject _H_0 \(and therefore fail to accept _Ha_\).

The null hypothesis typically represents the status quo, or what has historically been true. In the example of the respirators, we would believe the claim of the manufacturer unless there is reason not to do so, so the null hypotheses is H0:μ=75.H0:μ=75. The alternative hypothesis in the example is the contradictory statement Ha:μ&lt;75.Ha:μ&lt;75. The null hypothesis will always be an assertion containing an equals sign, but depending on the situation the alternative hypothesis can have any one of three forms: with the symbol “&lt;,” as in the example just discussed, with the symbol “&gt;,” or with the symbol “≠” The following two examples illustrate the latter two cases.

#### EXAMPLE 1

A publisher of college textbooks claims that the average price of all hardbound college textbooks is $127.50. A student group believes that the actual mean is higher and wishes to test their belief. State the relevant null and alternative hypotheses.

Solution:



#### EXAMPLE 2

The recipe for a bakery item is designed to result in a product that contains 8 grams of fat per serving. The quality control department samples the product periodically to insure that the production process is working as designed. State the relevant null and alternative hypotheses.

Solution:





In [Note 8.8 "Example 1"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s12-testing-hypotheses.html#fwk-shafer-ch08_s01_s01_n03), the textbook example, it might seem more natural that the publisher’s claim be that the average price is at most $127.50, not exactly $127.50. If the claim were made this way, then the null hypothesis would be H0:μ≤127.50H0:μ≤127.50, and the value $127.50 given in the example would be the one that is least favorable to the publisher’s claim, the null hypothesis. It is always true that if the null hypothesis is retained for its least favorable value, then it is retained for every other value.

Thus in order to make the null and alternative hypotheses easy for the student to distinguish, in every example and problem in this text we will always present one of the two competing claims about the value of a parameter with an equality. _The claim expressed with an equality is the null hypothesis._ This is the same as always stating the null hypothesis in the least favorable light. So in the introductory example about the respirators, we stated the manufacturer’s claim as “the average is 75 minutes” instead of the perhaps more natural “the average is at least 75 minutes,” essentially reducing the presentation of the null hypothesis to its worst case.

The first step in hypothesis testing is to identify the null and alternative hypotheses.

### The Logic of Hypothesis Testing

Although we will study hypothesis testing in situations other than for a single population mean \(for example, for a population proportion instead of a mean or in comparing the means of two different populations\), in this section the discussion will always be given in terms of a single population mean _μ_.

The null hypothesis always has the form H0:μ=μ0H0:μ=μ0 for a specific number μ0μ0 \(in the respirator example μ0=75μ0=75, in the textbook example μ0=127.50μ0=127.50, and in the baked goods example μ0=8.0μ0=8.0\). Since the null hypothesis is accepted unless there is strong evidence to the contrary, the test procedure is based on the initial assumption that _H_0 is true. This point is so important that we will repeat it in a display:

_The test procedure is based on the initial assumption that_ _H_0 _is true._

The criterion for judging between _H_0 and _Ha_ based on the sample data is: if the value of X−−X- would be highly unlikely to occur if _H_0 were true, but favors the truth of _Ha_, then we reject _H_0 in favor of _Ha_. Otherwise we do not reject _H_0.

Supposing for now that X−−X- follows a normal distribution, when the null hypothesis is true the density function for the sample mean X−−X- must be as in [Figure 8.1 "The Density Curve for "](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s12-testing-hypotheses.html#fwk-shafer-ch08_s01_s02_f01): a bell curve centered at μ0.μ0. Thus if _H_0 is true then X−−X- is likely to take a value near μ0μ0 and is unlikely to take values far away. Our decision procedure therefore reduces simply to:

1. if _Ha_ has the form Ha:μ&lt;μ0Ha:μ&lt;μ0 then reject _H_0 if x−−x- is far to the left of μ0μ0;
2. if _Ha_ has the form Ha:μ&gt;μ0Ha:μ&gt;μ0 then reject _H_0 if x−−x- is far to the right of μ0μ0;
3. if _Ha_ has the form Ha:μ≠μ0Ha:μ≠μ0 then reject _H_0 if x−−x- is far away from μ0μ0 in either direction.

Figure 8.1 The Density Curve for X−−X- if _H_0 Is True![](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/section_12/b91b73d0dbbd53dc069a390a463118a2.jpg)

Think of the respirator example, for which the null hypothesis is H0:μ=75H0:μ=75, the claim that the average time air is delivered for _all_ respirators is 75 minutes. If the sample mean is 75 or greater then we certainly would not reject _H_0 \(since there is no issue with an emergency respirator delivering air even longer than claimed\).

If the sample mean is slightly less than 75 then we would logically attribute the difference to sampling error and also not reject _H_0 either.

Values of the sample mean that are smaller and smaller are less and less likely to come from a population for which the population mean is 75. Thus if the sample mean is far less than 75, say around 60 minutes or less, then we would certainly reject _H_0, because we know that it is highly unlikely that the average of a sample would be so low if the population mean were 75. This is the _rare event criterion_ for rejection: what we actually observed \(X−−&lt;60X-&lt;60\) would be so rare an event if _μ_ = 75 were true that we regard it as much more likely that the alternative hypothesis _μ_ &lt; 75 holds.

In summary, to decide between _H_0 and _Ha_ in this example we would select a “rejection region” of values sufficiently far to the left of 75, based on the rare event criterion, and reject _H_0 if the sample mean X−−X- lies in the rejection region, but not reject _H_0 if it does not.

### The Rejection Region

Each different form of the alternative hypothesis _Ha_ has its own kind of rejection region:

1. if \(as in the respirator example\) _Ha_ has the form Ha:μ&lt;μ0Ha:μ&lt;μ0, we reject _H_0 if x−−x- is far to the left of μ0μ0, that is, to the left of some number _C_, so the rejection region has the form of an interval \(−∞,_C_\];
2. if \(as in the textbook example\) _Ha_ has the form Ha:μ&gt;μ0Ha:μ&gt;μ0, we reject _H_0 if x−−x- is far to the right of μ0μ0, that is, to the right of some number _C_, so the rejection region has the form of an interval \[_C_,∞\);
3. if \(as in the baked good example\) _Ha_ has the form Ha:μ≠μ0Ha:μ≠μ0, we reject _H_0 if x−−x- is far away from μ0μ0 in either direction, that is, either to the left of some number _C_ or to the right of some other number _C_′, so the rejection region has the form of the union of two intervals \(−∞,_C_\]∪\[_C_′,∞\).

The key issue in our line of reasoning is the question of how to determine the number _C_ or numbers _C_ and _C_′, called the _critical value_ or _critical values_ of the statistic, that determine the rejection region.

#### Definition

_The_ critical value _or_ **critical values** _of a test of hypotheses are the number or numbers that determine the rejection region._

Suppose the rejection region is a single interval, so we need to select a single number _C_. Here is the procedure for doing so. We select a small probability, denoted αα, say 1%, which we take as our definition of “rare event:” an event is “rare” if its probability of occurrence is less than α.α. \(In all the examples and problems in this text the value of αα will be given already.\) The probability that X−−X- takes a value in an interval is the area under its density curve and above that interval, so as shown in [Figure 8.2](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s12-testing-hypotheses.html#fwk-shafer-ch08_s01_s03_f01) \(drawn under the assumption that _H_0 is true, so that the curve centers at μ0μ0\) the critical value _C_ is the value of X−−X- that cuts off a tail area αα in the probability density curve of X−−.X-. When the rejection region is in two pieces, that is, composed of two intervals, the total area above both of them must be αα, so the area above each one is α∕2α∕2, as also shown in [Figure 8.2](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s12-testing-hypotheses.html#fwk-shafer-ch08_s01_s03_f01).

Figure 8.2![](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/section_12/72f0cd42fda04cdfb0341bcfe11601c1.jpg)

The number αα is the total area of a tail or a pair of tails.

#### EXAMPLE 3

In the context of [Note 8.9 "Example 2"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s12-testing-hypotheses.html#fwk-shafer-ch08_s01_s01_n04), suppose that it is known that the population is normally distributed with standard deviation _σ_ = 0.15 gram, and suppose that the test of hypotheses H0:μ=8.0H0:μ=8.0 versus Ha:μ≠8.0Ha:μ≠8.0 will be performed with a sample of size 5. Construct the rejection region for the test for the choice α=0.10.α=0.10. Explain the decision procedure and interpret it.

Solution:



Because the rejection regions are computed based on areas in tails of distributions, as shown in [Figure 8.2](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s12-testing-hypotheses.html#fwk-shafer-ch08_s01_s03_f01), hypothesis tests are classified according to the form of the alternative hypothesis in the following way.

#### Definition

_If_ _Ha_ _has the form_ μ≠μ0μ≠μ0 _the test is called a_ **two-tailed test**_._

_If_ _Ha_ _has the form_ μ&lt;μ0μ&lt;μ0 _the test is called a_ **left-tailed test**_._

_If_ _Ha_ _has the form_ μ&gt;μ0μ&gt;μ0 _the test is called a_ **right-tailed test**_._

_Each of the last two forms is also called a_ **one-tailed test**_._

### Two Types of Errors

The format of the testing procedure in general terms is to take a sample and use the information it contains to come to a decision about the two hypotheses. As stated before our decision will always be either

1. reject the null hypothesis _H_0 in favor of the alternative _Ha_ presented, or
2. do not reject the null hypothesis _H_0 in favor of the alternative _Ha_ presented.

There are four possible outcomes of hypothesis testing procedure, as shown in the following table:

|  | True State of Nature |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| _H_0 is true | _H_0 is false |  |  |
| Our Decision | Do not reject _H_0 | Correct decision | Type II error |
| Reject _H_0 | Type I error | Correct decision |  |

As the table shows, there are two ways to be right and two ways to be wrong. Typically to reject _H_0 when it is actually true is a more serious error than to fail to reject it when it is false, so the former error is labeled “Type I” and the latter error “Type II.”

#### Definition

_In a test of hypotheses, a_ Type I error _is the decision to reject_ _H_0 _when it is in fact true. A_ Type II error _is the decision not to reject_ _H_0 _when it is in fact not true._

Unless we perform a census we do not have certain knowledge, so we do not know whether our decision matches the true state of nature or if we have made an error. We reject _H_0 if what we observe would be a “rare” event if _H_0 were true. But rare events are not impossible: they occur with probability α.α. Thus when _H_0 is true, a rare event will be observed in the proportion αα of repeated similar tests, and _H_0 will be erroneously rejected in those tests. Thus αα is the probability that in following the testing procedure to decide between _H_0 and _Ha_ we will make a Type I error.

#### Definition

_The number_ αα _that is used to determine the rejection region is called the_ level of significance of the test_. It is the probability that the test procedure will result in a Type I error._

The probability of making a Type II error is too complicated to discuss in a beginning text, so we will say no more about it than this: for a fixed sample size, choosing αα smaller in order to reduce the chance of making a Type I error has the effect of increasing the chance of making a Type II error. The only way to simultaneously reduce the chances of making either kind of error is to increase the sample size.

### Standardizing the Test Statistic

Hypotheses testing will be considered in a number of contexts, and great unification as well as simplification results when the relevant sample statistic is _standardized_ by subtracting its mean from it and then dividing by its standard deviation. The resulting statistic is called a _standardized test statistic_. In every situation treated in this and the following two chapters the standardized test statistic will have either the standard normal distribution or Student’s _t_-distribution.

#### Definition

_A_ standardized test statistic _for a hypothesis test is the statistic that is formed by subtracting from the statistic of interest its mean and dividing by its standard deviation._

For example, reviewing [Note 8.14 "Example 3"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s12-testing-hypotheses.html#fwk-shafer-ch08_s01_s03_n02), if instead of working with the sample mean X−−X- we instead work with the test statisticX−−−8.00.067X-−8.00.067

then the distribution involved is standard normal and the critical values are just ±z0.05.±z0.05. The extra work that was done to find that _C_ = 7.89 and C′=8.11C′=8.11 is eliminated. In every hypothesis test in this book the standardized test statistic will be governed by either the standard normal distribution or Student’s _t_-distribution. Information about rejection regions is summarized in the following tables:

| When the test statistic has the standard normal distribution: |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Symbol in _Ha_ | Terminology | Rejection Region |
| &lt; | Left-tailed test | \(−∞,−zα\]\(−∞,−zα\] |
| &gt; | Right-tailed test | \[zα,∞\)\[zα,∞\) |
| ≠ | Two-tailed test | \(−∞,−zα∕2\]∪\[zα∕2,∞\)\(−∞,−zα∕2\]∪\[zα∕2,∞\) |

| When the test statistic has Student’s _t_-distribution: |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Symbol in _Ha_ | Terminology | Rejection Region |
| &lt; | Left-tailed test | \(−∞,−tα\]\(−∞,−tα\] |
| &gt; | Right-tailed test | \[tα,∞\)\[tα,∞\) |
| ≠ | Two-tailed test | \(−∞,−tα∕2\]∪\[tα∕2,∞\)\(−∞,−tα∕2\]∪\[tα∕2,∞\) |

Every instance of hypothesis testing discussed in this and the following two chapters will have a rejection region like one of the six forms tabulated in the tables above.

No matter what the context a test of hypotheses can always be performed by applying the following systematic procedure, which will be illustrated in the examples in the succeeding sections.

#### Systematic Hypothesis Testing Procedure: Critical Value Approach

1. Identify the null and alternative hypotheses.
2. Identify the relevant test statistic and its distribution.
3. Compute from the data the value of the test statistic.
4. Construct the rejection region.
5. Compare the value computed in Step 3 to the rejection region constructed in Step 4 and make a decision. Formulate the decision in the context of the problem, if applicable.

The procedure that we have outlined in this section is called the “Critical Value Approach” to hypothesis testing to distinguish it from an alternative but equivalent approach that will be introduced at the end of [Section 8.3 "The Observed Significance of a Test"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/fwk-shafer-ch08_s03#fwk-shafer-ch08_s03).
