# 8-5. Large Sample Tests for a Population Proportion

Both the critical value approach and the _p_-value approach can be applied to test hypotheses about a population proportion $$p$$ . 

The **null hypothesis** will have the form $$H_0:p=p_0$$ for some specific number $$p_0$$ between 0 and 1. 

The **alternative hypothesis** will be one of the _three inequalities_ $$p<p_0, p>p_0, or \space p≠p_0$$ for the same number $$p_0$$ that appears in the null hypothesis.

The information in [Section 6.3 "The Sample Proportion"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/fwk-shafer-ch06_s03#fwk-shafer-ch06_s03) in [Chapter 6 "Sampling Distributions"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s10-sampling-distributions.html) gives the following formula for the test statistic and its distribution. 

In the formula $$p_0$$ is the numerical value of $$p$$ that appears in the two hypotheses, $$q_0=1−p_0, \hat{p}$$ is the sample proportion, and $$n$$ is the sample size. Remember that the condition that the sample be large is not that $$n$$ be at least 30 but that the interval

lie wholly within the interval $$[0,1].$$

> The test statistic has the standard normal distribution.



The distribution of the standardized test statistic and the corresponding rejection region for each form of the alternative hypothesis \(left-tailed, right-tailed, or two-tailed\), is shown in [Figure 8.14 "Distribution of the Standardized Test Statistic and the Rejection Region"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s12-testing-hypotheses.html#fwk-shafer-ch08_s05_f01).

**EXAMPLE 12.** A soft drink maker claims that a majority of adults prefer its leading beverage over that of its main competitor’s. To test this claim 500 randomly selected people were given the two beverages in random order to taste. Among them, 270 preferred the soft drink maker’s brand, 211 preferred the competitor’s brand, and 19 could not make up their minds. Determine whether there is sufficient evidence, at the 5% level of significance, to support the soft drink maker’s claim against the default that the population is evenly split in its preference.

**\[ Solution \]**

We must check that the sample is sufficiently large to validly perform the test. Since 

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2876%29.png)

so the sample is sufficiently large.

* **Step 1**. The relevant test is  
               ****$$H0:p=0.50 vs. Ha:p>0.50, @ α=0.05$$ 

                 where _p_ denotes the proportion of all adults who prefer the company’s beverage over that of its competitor’s beverage.

* **Step 2**. The test statistic is  
                 $$ Z= (\hat{p}−p_0) / \sqrt{ \frac {p_0 q_0} {n} }$$ 

                 and has the standard normal distribution.

* **Step 3.** The value of the test statistic is  
                  $$ Z= \frac {(\hat{p}−p_0)} { \sqrt{ \frac {p_0 q_0} {n} } }= \frac {(0.54 - 0.50) } { \sqrt { \frac {(0.5) (0.5)}{500}}} = 1.789$$

* **Step 4.** Since the symbol in $$H_a$$ is “ $$>$$ ” this is a **right-tailed test**,                so there is a single critical value, $$z_α=z_{0.05}.$$                 Reading from the last line in [Figure 12.3 "Critical Values of "](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s16-appendix.html) its value is 1.645.               The rejection region is $$[1.645,∞).$$ 
* **Step 5.** the test statistic **falls in the rejection region**. The decision is **to reject** $$H_0$$ . 
* In the context of the problem our **conclusion** is:

  _The data provide sufficient evidence, at the 5% level of significance, to conclude that a majority of adults prefer the company’s beverage to that of their competitor’s._

**EXAMPLE 13.**  Globally the long-term proportion of newborns who are male is 51.46%. A researcher believes that the proportion of boys at birth changes under severe economic conditions. To test this belief randomly selected birth records of 5,000 babies born during a period of economic recession were examined. It was found in the sample that 52.55% of the newborns were boys. Determine whether there is sufficient evidence, at the 10% level of significance, to support the researcher’s belief.
