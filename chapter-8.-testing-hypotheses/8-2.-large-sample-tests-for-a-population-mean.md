# 8-2. Large Sample Tests for a Population Mean

In this section we describe and demonstrate the procedure for conducting a test of hypotheses about the mean of a population in the case that the sample size _n_ is at least 30. The Central Limit Theorem states that $$\bar{X}$$ is approximately normally distributed, and has mean $$μ_\bar{X}=μ$$ and standard deviation $$σ_\bar{X}=σ/\sqrt{n}$$ , where $$μ$$ and $$σ$$ are the mean and the standard deviation of the population. This implies that the statistic 

                                                                                     $$\frac { \bar{x} −μ } {σ/\sqrt{n}}$$ 

has the standard normal distribution, which means that probabilities related to it are given in [Figure 12.2 "Cumulative Normal Probability"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s16-appendix.html) and the last line in [Figure 12.3 "Critical Values of "](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s16-appendix.html).

If we know _σ_ then the statistic in the display is our test statistic. If, as is typically the case, we do not know _σ_, then we replace it by the sample standard deviation _s_. Since the sample is large the resulting test statistic still has a distribution that is approximately standard normal.

#### Standardized Test Statistics for Large Sample Hypothesis Tests Concerning a Single Population Mean

 If σ is known: Z=x−−−μ0σ/n√ If σ is unknown: Z=x−−−μ0s/n√ If σ is known: Z=x-−μ0σ∕n If σ is unknown: Z=x-−μ0s∕n

The test statistic has the standard normal distribution.

The distribution of the standardized test statistic and the corresponding rejection region for each form of the alternative hypothesis \(left-tailed, right-tailed, or two-tailed\), is shown in [Figure 8.4 "Distribution of the Standardized Test Statistic and the Rejection Region"](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introductory-statistics/s12-02-large-sample-tests-for-a-popul.html).

**EXAMPLE 4.** It is hoped that a newly developed pain reliever will more quickly produce perceptible reduction in pain to patients after minor surgeries than a standard pain reliever. The standard pain reliever is known to bring relief in an average of 3.5 minutes with standard deviation 2.1 minutes. To test whether the new pain reliever works more quickly than the standard one, 50 patients with minor surgeries were given the new pain reliever and their times to relief were recorded. The experiment yielded sample mean $$\bar{x} = 3.1$$ minutes and sample standard deviation $$s = 1.5$$ minutes. Is there sufficient evidence in the sample to indicate, at the 5% level of significance, that the newly developed pain reliever does deliver perceptible relief more quickly?

**EXAMPLE 5.** A cosmetics company fills its best-selling 8-ounce jars of facial cream by an automatic dispensing machine. The machine is set to dispense a mean of 8.1 ounces per jar. Uncontrollable factors in the process can shift the mean away from 8.1 and cause either underfill or overfill, both of which are undesirable. In such a case the dispensing machine is stopped and recalibrated. Regardless of the mean amount dispensed, the standard deviation of the amount dispensed always has value 0.22 ounce. A quality control engineer routinely selects 30 jars from the assembly line to check the amounts filled. On one occasion, the sample mean is $$\bar{x} = 8.2$$ ounces and the sample standard deviation is $$s = 0.25$$ ounce. Determine if there is sufficient evidence in the sample to indicate, at the 1% level of significance, that the machine should be recalibrated.
